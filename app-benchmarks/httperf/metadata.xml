	<longdescription lang="en">Httperf is a tool for measuring web server
		performance. It provides a flexible facility for generating various HTTP
		workloads and for measuring server performance. The focus of httperf is
		not on implementing one particular benchmark but on providing a robust,
		high-performance tool that facilitates the construction of both micro-
		and macro-level benchmarks. The three distinguishing characteristics of
		httperf are its robustness, which includes the ability to generate and
		sustain server overload, support for the HTTP/1.1 and SSL protocols, and
		its extensibility to new workload generators and performance
		measurements.</longdescription>
