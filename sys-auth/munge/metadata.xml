	<longdescription>MUNGE (MUNGE Uid 'N' Gid Emporium) is an authentication service for creating
	and validating credentials. It is designed to be highly scalable for use in
	an HPC cluster environment. It allows a process to authenticate the UID and
	GID of another local or remote process within a group of hosts having common
	users and groups. These hosts form a security realm that is defined by a
	shared cryptographic key. Clients within this security realm can create and
	validate credentials without the use of root privileges, reserved ports, or
	platform-specific methods.</longdescription>
