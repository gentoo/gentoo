#  This is pam_radius_auth configuration file.
#
#  There are 3 fields per line in this file.  There may be multiple
#  lines.  Blank lines or lines beginning with '#' are treated as
#  comments, and are ignored.  The fields are:
#
#  server[:port] secret [timeout]
#
#  the port name or number is optional.  The default port name is
#  "radius", and is looked up from /etc/services The timeout field is
#  optional.  The default timeout is 3 seconds.
#
#  If multiple RADIUS server lines exist, they are tried in order.  The
#  first server to return success or failure causes the module to return
#  success or failure.  Only if a server fails to response is it skipped,
#  and the next server in turn is used.
#
#  The timeout field controls how many seconds the module waits before
#  deciding that the server has failed to respond.
#
# server[:port]	shared_secret      timeout (s)
# 127.0.0.1	secret             1
# other-server	other-secret       3
