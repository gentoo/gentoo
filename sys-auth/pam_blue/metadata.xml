    Bluepam is an extension for the common pam modules, give the user the
    ability for authenticaten via a bluetooth compatible device like a cell
    phone or various other bluetooth dongles (e.g. epox-presenter). Due to the
    fact that a whole part of the bluetooth stack is implemented in hardware it
    is relatively difficult to change the bluetoth hardware mac address which
    makes this module more secure.
