		Cebuano is the second most widely spoken native language of the Philippines. The complete Cebuano Bible was first published in 1917. This Bible is published today as the Ang Biblia, Cebuano by the Philippine Bible Society. Two separate versions are available: The 'Bugna' version contains the original New Testament from 1917. The 'Pinadayag' version contains a completely revised New Testament which follows a Critical Greek Text. Both versions share the same Old Testament text. The 'Pinadayag' designation is derived from the Cebuano name given to the book of Revelation.
