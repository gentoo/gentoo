		This work is an electronic reproduction of C.F.W. Walther's Law and Gospel, published by Concordia Publishing House in 1929. As the 1929 edition was not copyrighted, it is in the public domain. In 1989, CPH released a copyrighted edition of Law and Gospel. That work was not consulted in the production of this online edition. Converted to SWORD module format by Brian Dumont (brian dot j dot dumont at gmail dot com)
