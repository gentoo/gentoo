		The New Testament in the Original Greek: Byzantine Textform 2005, edited
		by Maurice A. Robinson and William G. Pierpont. This is the edition by Pierpont
		and Robinson of a Majority, or Byzantine, text of the NT. It is similar to an
		earlier production of Hodges and Farstad in being based on von Soden's
		apparatus, but without their stemmatic reconstruction of the Apocalypse and
		the Pericope Adulterae.
