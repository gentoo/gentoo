		This translation of the Holy Bible is originally based upon Henry Martyn's
		translation of the Bible in Persian. After repeated updates it was finally
		published in the current form in 1896 and again, with new headlines in 1996
		and subsequently by Elam Ministries with new headings and cross references.
		These headlines are not included in this version. It is currently in use
		within most Iranian and Afghani churches under the name "Tarjumeh-ye Ghadeem"
		or "Old Translation". It is famous for its literary quality and faithfulness
		to the original texts. Its original copyright holder, the Iranian Bible
		Society, was dissolved by force by the Iranian post-revolutionary government
		in 1990. In all likelihood this text is now public domain simply due to its
		age, but users are asked to respect the International Bible Society's request
		to use this text only in non-commercial ways until full clarity on its legal
		status has been obtained.
