# Note to developers:
# This is a wrapper for the extra apps integrated with GNOME 3
# Keep pkg order within a USE flag as upstream releng versions file
# TODO: Should we keep these here: gnome-dictionary, gucharmap, sound-juicer, vinagre; replace gucharmap with gnome-characters?
# TODO: Add gnome-remote-desktop as replacement for vino that was removed from meta in 3.36?
# gnome-documents removed for now, as it didn't find a good place upstream and is getting dropped from default sets for distros for 3.30 (and for 3.26 it required newer tracker than we had at the time)
