DESCRIPTION="Meta package for GNOME-Light, merge this package to install"

KEYWORDS="amd64 ~arm ~ppc64 x86"

# XXX: Note to developers:
# This is a wrapper for the 'light' GNOME 3 desktop, and should only consist of
# the bare minimum of libs/apps needed. It is basically gnome-base/gnome without
# any apps, but shouldn't be used by users unless they know what they are doing.
# cantarell minimum version is ensured here as gnome-shell depends on it.

# adwaita-icon-theme kept back on purpose due to brokenness without rust librsvg,
# in the hope that the old icon package version is good enough for everything too
# until librsvg gets updated. This dep should be raised to 3.34 with 3.34.5 meta.
