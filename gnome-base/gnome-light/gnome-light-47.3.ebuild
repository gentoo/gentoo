# XXX: Note to developers:
# This is a wrapper for the 'light' GNOME 3 desktop, and should only consist of
# the bare minimum of libs/apps needed. It is basically gnome-base/gnome without
# any apps, but shouldn't be used by users unless they know what they are doing.
# cantarell minimum version is ensured here as gnome-shell depends on it.
