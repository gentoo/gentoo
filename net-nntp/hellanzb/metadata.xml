		hellanzb is a Python application designed for *nix environments that
		retrieves nzb files and fully processes them. The goal being to make
		getting files from Usenet (e.g.: Giganews Newsgroups) as hands-free as
		possible. Once fully installed, all thats required is moving an nzb file
		to the queue directory. The rest; fetching, par-checking, un-raring,
		etc. is taken care of by hellanzb.
