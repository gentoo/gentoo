  <title>SDL_image: Two buffer overflow vulnerabilities</title>
  <synopsis>
    Two boundary errors have been identified in SDL_image allowing for the
    remote execution of arbitrary code or the crash of the application using
    the library.

    <p>
    SDL_image is an image file library that loads images as SDL surfaces,
    and supports various formats like BMP, GIF, JPEG, LBM, PCX, PNG, PNM,
    TGA, TIFF, XCF, XPM, and XV.

  <description>
    <p>
    The LWZReadByte() function in file IMG_gif.c and the IMG_LoadLBM_RW()
    function in file IMG_lbm.c each contain a boundary error that can be
    triggered to cause a static buffer overflow and a heap-based buffer
    overflow. The first boundary error comes from some old vulnerable GD
    PHP code (CVE-2006-4484).
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A remote attacker can make an application using the SDL_image library
    to process a specially crafted GIF file or IFF ILBM file that will
    trigger a buffer overflow, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code
    with the permissions of the application or the application crash.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All SDL_image users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=media-libs/sdl-image-1.2.6-r1"</code>
  </resolution>
