	sobexsrv is a Bluetooth OBEX server with Bluetooth Security
	Mode-2 (application triggered security) support. It implements
	OPUSH (put), OPULL (get) and OBEX-FTP (setpath + directory
	listing) and therefore is a full OBEX server. Further it
	supports pulling generic mime-types and provides a capability
	object. sobexsrv was designed with flexibility and security in
	mind and supports chroot (if suid root drop to calling uid
	immediately). For flexibility a scripting interface provides
	access to all functionalities of the server and therefore
	allows implementation of further OBEX services on top of
	sobexsrv.
