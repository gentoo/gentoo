    <longdescription>sobexsrv is a Bluetooth OBEX server with Bluetooth
Security Mode-2 (application triggered security) support. It implements
OPUSH (put), OPULL (get) and OBEX-FTP (setpath + directory listing) and
therefore is a full OBEX server. Further it supports pulling generic
mime-types and provides a capability object. sobexsrv was designed with
flexibility and security in mind and supports chroot (if suid root drop to
calling uid immediately). For flexibility a scripting interface provides
access to all functionalities of the server and therefore allows
implementation of further OBEX services on top of sobexsrv.</longdescription>
