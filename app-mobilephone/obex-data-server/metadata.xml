		A DBus service providing easy to use API for using OBEX protocol
		(both client and server wise). Current implementation supports OPP
		(Object Push Profile) and FTP (File Transfer Profile). This means
		that you can have FTP server running on your Bluetooth adapter with
		several lines of python, you can also do all client operations without
		having to use openobex directly or knowing any of low-level OBEX stuff.
