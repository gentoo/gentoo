Post-Upgrade Activities
-----------------------
1. Check .htaccess settings (some php settings could become required)
2. If you're using build-in addressbook, run indexing script
   /bin/indexcontacts.sh.
3. When upgrading from version older than 0.6-beta you should make sure
   your folder settings contain namespace prefix. For example Courier users
   should add INBOX. prefix to folder names in main configuration file.
4. Check system requirements in INSTALL file.

SQLite database upgrade
-----------------------
Versions older than 0.9 were supporting SQLite v2 only. Newer versions require
database in v3 format. The best what you can do is to convert database file
to the new format using command line tools:

sqlite OLD.DB .dump | sqlite3 NEW.DB
