  GL2PS is a C library providing high quality vector output for any
  OpenGL application. The main difference between GL2PS and other
  similar libraries is the use of sorting algorithms
  capable of handling intersecting and stretched polygons, as well as
  non manifold objects. GL2PS provides advanced smooth shading and
  text rendering, culling of invisible primitives, mixed vector/bitmap
  output, and much more.
