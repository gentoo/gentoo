  The XPA messaging system provides seamless communication between many
  kinds of Unix programs, including X programs and Tcl/Tk programs. 
  It also provides an easy way for users to communicate with these 
  XPA-enabled programs by executing XPA client commands in the shell or
  by utilizing such commands in scripts. Because XPA works both at the
  programming level and the shell level, it is a powerful tool for
  unifying any analysis environment: users and programmers have great
  flexibility in choosing the best level or levels at which to access
  XPA services, and client access can be extended or modified easily
  at any time.
