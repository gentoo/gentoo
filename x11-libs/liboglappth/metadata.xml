Ghemical supports both quantum-mechanics (semi-empirical and ab initio) models 
and molecular mechanics models (there is an experimental Tripos 5.2-like force 
field for organic molecules). Also a tool for reduced protein models is 
included. Geometry optimization, molecular dynamics and a large set of 
visualization tools are currently available.
