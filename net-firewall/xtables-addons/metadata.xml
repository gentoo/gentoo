	Xtables-addons is the successor to patch-o-matic(-ng). Likewise, it contains
	extensions that were not, or are not yet, accepted in the main kernel/iptables
	packages.

	Xtables-addons is different from patch-o-matic in that you do not have to patch
	or recompile the kernel, sometimes recompiling iptables is also not needed. But
	please see the INSTALL file for the minimum requirements of this package.
