  Spectromatic is a program for generating spectrograms from audio
  files. Spectrograms are a form of simple time-frequency analysis which
  lets you see how the distribution of energy at different frequencies
  in an audio stream change over time. For example, if you play a scale
  on a musical instrument, you will see a climbing and/or descending
  pattern of blobs as you move from left to right.  
  Spectromatic reads its input as mono or stereo 16-bit wave files, and
  writes the output image to an elongated PNG image (colour for stereo,
  grayscale for mono audio).
