  Mayavi2 is a general purpose, cross-platform tool for 3-D scientific
  data visualization. Its features include:
  * Visualization of scalar, vector and tensor data in 2 and 3 dimensions.
  * Easy scriptability using Python.
  * Easy extendibility via custom sources, modules, and data filters.
  * Reading several file formats: VTK (legacy and XML), PLOT3D, etc.
  * Saving of visualizations. 
  * Saving rendered visualization in a variety of image formats.
  * Convenient functionality for rapid scientific plotting via mlab

  Mayavi2 has been designed with scriptability and extensibility in
  mind. Mayavi2 provides a mayavi2 application which is usable by
  itself. However, Mayavi2 may also be used as a plotting engine, in
  scripts, like with matplotlib or gnuplot, as well as a library for
  interactive visualizations in any other application. It may also be
  used as an Envisage plug-in which allows it to be embedded in other
  Envisage based applications natively.
