  Circos visualizes data in a circular layout — this makes Circos
  ideal for exploring relationships between objects or
  positions. Circos is ideal for creating publication-quality
  infographics and illustrations with a high data-to-ink ratio, richly
  layered data and pleasant symmetries. You have fine control each element
  in the figure to tailor its focus points and detail to your audience.
