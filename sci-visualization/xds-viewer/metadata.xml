  XDS-Viewer is a program for viewing X-ray diffraction and control
  images in the context of data processing by the XDS Program Package
  (external link). Potential users of the software are scientists
  working in the field of crystallography. The XDS-Viewer is a
  standalone program which has build-in support for a subset of the
  Crystallographic Binary File Format CBF (external link). Other file
  formats are supported through an external convertion program that
  comes with XDS. XDS-Viewer will automatically invoke the convertion
  program for images other than CBF.
