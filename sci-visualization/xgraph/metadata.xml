    Accepts data files or stdin in a form similar to the unix program
    graph and displays line graphs, scatter plots, or bar charts on an
    X11 display. Fully annotated with title, axis numbering and
    labels, and legend. Zooming with the mouse is supported. Can
    generate hardcopy output to Postscript printers and HPGL
    plotters. Output can be directly pasted into idraw (drawtool) for
    further annotation. Particularly useful in shell scripts.
