  Quickplot is a fast interactive 2D plotter with infinite zooming, value
  picking, pipe input, and unlimited plots displayed.  Quickplot is meant for
  looking at your data quickly and of secondary importance is making static
  pictures of your data. It's a data viewer, not a plot editor.  It reads
  ASCII text and sound files. It has lots of command line options, making it
  very shell script friendly.
