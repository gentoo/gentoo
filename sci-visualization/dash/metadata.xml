		Dash is a productive Python framework for building web analytic
		applications.
		Written on top of Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js, Dash is ideal for
		building data visualization apps with highly custom user interfaces in
		pure Python. It's particularly suited for anyone who works with data in
		Python.
		Through a couple of simple patterns, Dash abstracts away all of the
		technologies and protocols that are required to build an interactive
		web-based application. Dash is simple enough that you can bind a user
		interface around your Python code in an afternoon.
		Dash apps are rendered in the web browser. You can deploy your apps to
		servers and then share them through URLs. Since Dash apps are viewed in
		the web browser, Dash is inherently cross-platform and mobile ready.
		Dash ships with supercharged components for interactive user
		interfaces. A core set of components, written and maintained by the
		Dash team, is available in the dash-core-components library.
