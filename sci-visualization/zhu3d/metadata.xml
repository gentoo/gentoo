  Zhu3D allows you to interactively view and animate mathematical
  functions, isosurfaces and a further independent parametric system.
  Numerical solutions of equation systems are found with an adaptive
  random search. The OpenGL-viewer supports zooming, scaling, rotating
  and translating as well as filed lightning or surface properties.
  Special effects are transparency, textures, fog and motion blur.
