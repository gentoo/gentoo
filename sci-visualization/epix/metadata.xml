  ePiX creates mathematically accurate figures, plots, and
  movies using easy-to-learn syntax. The output is expressly suitable
  for use with LaTeX; figures may be written in a LaTeX picture
  environment containing PSTricks, tikz, or eepic macros, or as vector
  (EPS or PDF) image files. The user interface resembles that of
  LaTeX: You prepare a human-readable scene description in a text
  editor, then compile the input file into a picture.
  use ePiX, however.
