Lasca (or Laska) is a game similar to Draughts but with some really cool
enhancements. You'll find a great description in the help system of Ascal. In
the meantime the article on Wikipedia and on
http://research.interface.co.uk/lasca/about.htm will help you understanding the
rules. Ascal tries to give a great Gnome Version of Lasca for one and two
players. You can undo moves, save and load games and all that on a nifty
graphical board.
