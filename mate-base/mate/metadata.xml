		<flag name="base">Install base MATE Desktop applications that are
			recommended for the most common usage; for example, this installs
			the file manager. Disable this and other USE flags if you want a
			more minimal MATE Desktop.</flag>
		<flag name="themes">Install MATE Desktop's themes; if you use other
			themes, you can disable this to spare some space and time.</flag>
		<flag name="extras">Install additional MATE Desktop applications that
			are recommended for extended usage of the MATE Desktop as upstream
			sees it; for example, this installs MATE Desktop's office related
			applications. Disable this if you plan to use your own non-MATE
