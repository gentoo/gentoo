.SH NAME
renpy \- a visual novel engine

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI renpy " game_directory"
.\" ****************************************************************
.SH DESCRIPTION

.B renpy
(Ren'Py) is a visual novel engine \- used by hundreds of creators
from around the world \- that helps you use words, images, and
sounds to tell interactive stories that run on computers and mobile
devices. These can be both visual novels and life simulation games.
The easy to learn script language allows anyone to efficiently
write large visual novels, while its 
.BR python (1)
scripting is enough for complex simulation games.
.\" ****************************************************************
.SH RUNNING A GAME

In order to run a game, provide
.I game_directory
as an argument to
.BR renpy .
Exact directory name may vary depending or a game, but usually
this path corresponds to
.I */game
wildcard and contains
.I script_version.rpy*
file within. Game directory usually contains other
.IR *.rpy* " and  " *.rpa " files."

One may use
.BR find (1)
tool to locate required directory within unpacked game top
directory:
.RS

find -O3 
.I top_directory
-type f -iname "script_version.rpy*"

.RE
A directory one level above may be provided as an argument as well.
.\" ****************************************************************
.SH PORTABILITY

All
.B renpy
games are written in
.BR python (1),
so one can run then on any platform and architecture.

As you may have noticed, Ren'Py games are often distributed in
different archives for different architectures. This happens due to
bundling of
.BR python (1)
interpreter and required libraries in a game's tarball. Since you
are using OS native
.B renpy
setup, you should be able to run any of these games.
.\" ****************************************************************
.SH GAMES CATALOGUE

A large catalogue of Ren'Py powered games is available at
.IR http://games.renpy.org/ .
.\" ****************************************************************
.SH TROUBLESHOOTING

In some cases game may fail to run with current
.B renpy
version due to various errors.

In such case please try to use the closest
.B renpy
version to one used by game developer. Most games contain
.IR script_version.rpy " file in the " game " directory."
This file actually contains
.B renpy
version used during a game build.
You may install multiple slots of
.B renpy
in Gentoo and use
.BI eselect " renpy"
module to switch between various versions.

If
.I game
directory contains both 
.IR *.rpyc " (or " *.rpyo ") and " *.rpy " files, delete"
.IR *.rpyc " (or " *.rpyo ") files, they will be regenerated by"
the interpreter.
Another solution will be to switch between version of
.BR python (1)
using
.IR eselect (1)
tool in order to find one suitable to interpret game's
.IR *.rpyc " files."

Some games may lack general media files, e.g.
.I click.ogg
sound, so you should create or download one and place in the
.I game
directory.

Also please pay attention to
.I problems.html
page from
.B renpy
html documentation, see
.B FURTHER READING
section.
