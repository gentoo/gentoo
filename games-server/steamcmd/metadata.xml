		The Steam Console Client or SteamCMD is a command-line version of the Steam client.
		Its primary use is to install and update various dedicated servers available on Steam
		using a command-line interface. It works with games that use the SteamPipe content system.
		All games have been migrated from the deprecated HLDSUpdateTool to SteamCMD.
