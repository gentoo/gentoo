Cyphesis is an NPC engine using AI/A-Life techniques. It is the Artificial
Intelligence and Artificial Life server used by STAGE and also is filling in as
its first fully functional game server, featured in Acorn. Cyphesis is a
prototype server designed to explore the possibilities of complex NPC
interaction and scripting. Efficiency and support for large numbers of players
are foregone in the quest for a more realistic and dynamic world framework.
