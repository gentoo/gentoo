Unreal Tounament 2003 is a first-person 3-D shooter and sequel to the 1999 Game of the Year, Unreal Tournament.  The game was ported to Linux by Ryan "icculus" Gordon under contract from Epic Games and the Linux installer was released in the retail box.  This is the dedicated server portion of the game and does not require the retail discs to use.
