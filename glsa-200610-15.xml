    Asterisk is an open source implementation of a telephone private branch
    exchange (PBX).

  <description>
    <p>
    Asterisk contains buffer overflows in channels/chan_mgcp.c from the
    MGCP driver and in channels/chan_skinny.c from the Skinny channel
    driver for Cisco SCCP phones. It also dangerously handles
    client-controlled variables to determine filenames in the Record()
    function. Finally, the SIP channel driver in channels/chan_sip.c could
    use more resources than necessary under unspecified circumstances.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code by sending a crafted
    audit endpoint (AUEP) response, by sending an overly large Skinny
    packet even before authentication, or by making use of format strings
    specifiers through the client-controlled variables. An attacker could
    also cause a Denial of Service by resource consumption through the SIP
    channel driver.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround for the format strings vulnerability at
    this time. You can comment the lines in /etc/asterisk/mgcp.conf,
    /etc/asterisk/skinny.conf and /etc/asterisk/sip.conf to deactivate the
    three vulnerable channel drivers. Please note that the MGCP channel
    driver is disabled by default.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Asterisk users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=net-misc/asterisk-1.2.13"</code>
  </resolution>
