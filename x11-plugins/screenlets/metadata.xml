		Screenlets are small owner-drawn applications (written in Python) that
		can be described as "the virtual representation of things lying/standing
		around on your desk". Sticknotes, clocks, rulers, ... the possibilities
		are endless.

		The goal of the Screenlets base-classes is to simplify the creation of
		fully themeable mini-apps that each solve basic desktop-work-related
		needs and generally improve the usability and eye-candy of the modern
		composited Linux-desktop.
