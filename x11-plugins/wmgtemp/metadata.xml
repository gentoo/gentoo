wmgtemp is a dock-app for Window Maker that graphically displays the CPU and 
System temperatures using the lm_sensors package. It was originally intended to 
work with the VIA686A chipset although it can dynamically detect chipset 
features to work with other sensors. It displays the CPU and System temperature 
values, a scaling graph of temperature history, and high-temperature warning 
lights. It should also work fine with other window managers.
