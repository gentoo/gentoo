wmcpuwatch aims to show the load of every logical CPU on the system.

It is a fork of wmmon. wmmon shows the load of up to 10 CPUs. With a little tweaking it is possible to show 12 with wmmon, but when in 2017 Intel announced a 18 core CPU (and AMD was with their Ryzen even earlier), there was time for a new dockapp.

wmcpuwatch now shows the load of all CPUs in the lower frame which allows 40 CPUs at max.
