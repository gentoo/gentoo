		wmMoonClock displays phases and ephemeris of the Moon. Clicking on the App
		cycles the user through several `pages' of ephemeris information. Included are
		age, fraction of current lunar cycle, the % illumination, whether its currently
		visible or not, the rise/set times for yesterday, today and tomorrow, the
		`horizon coordinates", and the "ecliptic coordinates". wmMoonClock supports
		8-bit and high-color displays.
