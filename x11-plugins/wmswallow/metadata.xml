wmswallow is a WindowMaker dock applet that makes any application dockable. You 
can define an action to be taken on a mouseclick if the window does not receive 
mouseclicks itself, and you can define the size and width of the swallowed 
window on the commandline. Applications may be started on the commandline and 
specified via name, class, or window-id.
