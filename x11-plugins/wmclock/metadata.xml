Wmclock is an applet which displays the date and time in a dockable tile. 
Wmclock is specially designed for Window Maker, and features multiple language 
support, twenty-four-hour and twelve-hour (am/pm) time display, and, 
optionally, can run a user-specified program on a mouse click. Wmclock is 
derived from ASClock (now called ASClock classic), a similar clock for the 
AfterStep window manager.
