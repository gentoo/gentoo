wmnet polls network statistics and does a few things with the data it gets. It 
has small blinking lights for the rx and tx of ip packets, a digital 
speedometer of your tcp/ip stack's current speed and neatest of all, a bar 
graph like xload et. al which has a tx speed graph from bottom-up and rx speed 
graph from the top-down. The speedometer keeps track of the current speed per 
second and shows it in a color corresponding to which of rx or tx that has the 
highest speed at the moment.
