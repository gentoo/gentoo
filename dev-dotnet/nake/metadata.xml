    Nake is a magic task runner tool for .NET Core. It's a hybrid of Shovel and
    Rake. The DSL for defining tasks is uniquely minimal and it's just plain
    (naked) C# code! Nake is built on top of the latest Roslyn release so you
    can use all of the latest C# features in you scripts and even more.
