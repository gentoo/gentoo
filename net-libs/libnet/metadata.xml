Libnet is a high-level API (toolkit) allowing the application 
programmer to construct and inject network packets. It provides a 
portable and simplified interface for low-level network packet 
shaping, handling and injection. Libnet hides much of the tedium 
of packet creation from the application programmer such as 
multiplexing, buffer management, arcane packet header 
information, byte-ordering, OS-dependent issues, and much more. 
Libnet features portable packet creation interfaces at the IP 
layer and link layer, as well as a host of supplementary and 
complementary functionality. Using libnet, quick and simple 
packet assembly applications can be whipped up with little 
effort. With a bit more time, more complex programs can be 
written (Traceroute and ping were easily rewritten using libnet 
and libpcap).
