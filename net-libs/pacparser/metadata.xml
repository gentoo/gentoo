  A library to parse proxy auto-config (PAC) files. Proxy auto-config
  files are a vastly used proxy configuration method these days. Web
  browsers can use a PAC file to determine which proxy server to use
  or whether to go direct for a given URL. PAC files are written in
  JavaScript and can be programmed to return different proxy methods
  (e.g. "PROXY proxy1:port; DIRECT") depending upon URL, source IP
  address, protocol, time of the day etc. PAC files introduce a lot
  of possibilities. 
  Needless to say, PAC files are now a widely accepted method for
  proxy configuration management and companies all over are using
  them in corporate environments. Almost all popular web browsers
  support PAC files. The idea behind pacparser is to make it easy to
  add this PAC file parsing capability to  any program (C and Python
  supported right now).
