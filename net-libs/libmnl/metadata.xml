	libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
	There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of both
	the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong. This
	library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code and to
	avoid re-inventing the wheel.
