If you don't know VNC, have a look at the original VNC or at Tridia 
VNC, who also have commercial support for it.

Now that you know what it is, maybe you want to make your own server. If 
this is not the case, you can ignore the rest of this page an go on 
surfing the internet.

Now that you want to make a VNC server, that is, a server which speaks 
the RFB protocol, you can download this library from sourceforge.
