Marble Blast is an arcade action game with simple yet addictive gameplay, 
suitable for players of any age. In the rich cartoon landscape of Marble 
Blast, players will race their marbles through moving platforms, dangerous 
hazards, sparkling treasures and power up enhancements in an effort to 
complete each course in record time.

Marble Blast introduces new players to the game with a set of 
progressively more difficult beginner training levels, each designed to 
showcase a power up or game hazard. The hazards players will face in 
Marble Blast include powerful fans, whirling tornados, land mines, 
pinball-style bumpers, narrow catwalks, moving pistons, dizzying chasms, 
and more.

To get past these obstacles, players can find and use five different 
ability enhancing power ups - the SuperSpeed, SuperJump, SuperBounce, 
Shock Asbsorber and Gyrocopter. Some levels contain gravity modifiers, 
which allow the player to change the direction of gravity.

Marble Blast comes with 72 whimsical and challenging levels, as well as 
the ability for advanced players to craft and share their own levels. 
Marble Blast is sure to provide many hours of fun for the whole family.
