"Super Transbal 2" is the sequel of "Transball" and "Transball 2", Inspired in
THRUST type of games (and concretely in ZARA THRUSTA for the Amiga 500). In each
level of Transball, the goal is to find the SPHERE, capture it and carry it to
the upper part of the level. The main obstacle is the gravity, that impulses you
towards the ground. But many other obstacles, canons, tanks, doors, etc. will
try to make difficult your journey...
