	<longdescription>Jardinains 2!, the sequel to Jardinains 1! (surprisingly
	enough) is a fairly straightforward game. You have a paddle. You have a
	ball. You have a whole bunch of bricks. Inside these bricks live ‘nains.
	‘Nains are cute little critters who pop out of their bricks every now and
	then to have some fun and give you a headache. </longdescription>
