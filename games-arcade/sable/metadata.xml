Sable is a frantic 3d space shooter inspired by games such as After Burner and
Space Harrier. You pilot a ship through an obstacle-laden landscape and attack
or evade swarms of enemies.

The game itself is quite easy to play. The arrow keys move your ship, and the
space bar fires your cannons. Holding down the space bar produces a rapid-fire
effect. Avoid enemy craft, enemy shots, and the pylons. Pylons are destroyable
but require concentrated fire to destroy.
