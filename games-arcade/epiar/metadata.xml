	Epiar is a space adventure/combat game written in C with SDL
	(Simple DirectMedia Layer). It is absolutely free (released
	under the General Public License v2).
	In Epiar, you begin as a shuttle pilot in a galaxy generally
	ruled by anarchy, with few stable governments and numerous
	rebel factions. You start your adventure off doing whatever
	you want, but generally trying to save up money for a new
	starship, and your adventure takes off from there ...
