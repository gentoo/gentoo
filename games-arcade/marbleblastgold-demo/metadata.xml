Marble Blast Gold is an arcade action game with simple yet 
addictive gameplay, suitable for players of any age. In the 
rich cartoon landscape of Marble Blast Gold, players will race 
their marbles through moving platforms, dangerous hazards, 
sparkling treasures and power up enhancements in an effort to 
complete each course in record time.

Marble Blast Gold introduces new players to the game with a set 
of progressively more difficult beginner training levels, each 
designed to showcase a power up or game hazard. The hazards 
players will face in Marble Blast include powerful fans, 
whirling tornados, land mines, pinball-style bumpers, narrow 
catwalks, moving pistons, dizzying chasms, and more.

To get past these obstacles, players can find and use five 
different ability enhancing power ups - the SuperSpeed, 
SuperJump, SuperBounce, Shock Absorber and Gyrocopter. Some 
levels contain gravity modifiers, which allow the player to 
change the direction of gravity.

Marble Blast Gold comes with 100 whimsical and challenging 
levels, as well as the ability for advanced players to craft 
and share their own levels. Each level has "gold standard" set 
for the high score, so you can test your skills against the 
record 'gold' times. Marble Blast Gold is sure to provide many 
hours of fun for the whole family.
