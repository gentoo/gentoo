		Not Tetris 2 is the spiritual successor of the classic Tetris
		mixed with physics. The result is a fun spinoff in which blocks
		are no longer bound to the usual grid. Blocks can be rotated and
		placed at any angle, resulting in a complete mess if not careful.
		And with the newest cutting edge technology, Not tetris 2 allows
		line clears when the lines are sufficiently filled. The old mode
		is still available for play and is now called Stack.
