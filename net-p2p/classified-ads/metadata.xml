		Classified ads is an attempt to re-produce parts of the functionality
		that went away when Usenet news ceased to exist. This attempt tries to
		fix the problem of disappearing news-servers so that there is no servers
		required and no service-providers needed for any operation ;
		data storage is implemented inside client applications that
		users are running. Features of the program currently include:

		* Posting of ads online. Ads have a category ; there are some pre-defined categories but more can be invented just by typing over the suggested categories.
		* Replying to ads either in public or privately to operator.
		* (Small-sized) binary attachments to posts.
		* Providing basic data of operators - data that operator may enter himself, or leave blank.
		* Basic searching of content based on words.
