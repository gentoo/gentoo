   Classified ads is an attempt to re-produce parts of the functionality
   that went away when Usenet news ceased to exist. This attempt tries to
   fix the problem of disappearing news-servers so that there is no servers
   required and no service-providers needed for any operation ;
   data storage is implemented inside client applications that
   users are running. Features of the program currently include:

 * Posting of ads online. Ads have a category ; there are some 
   pre-defined categories but more can be invented just by typing 
   over the suggested categories.
 * Replying to ads either in public or privately to operator.
 * (Small-sized) binary attachments to posts.
 * Providing basic data of operators - data that operator may enter 
   himself, or leave blank.
 * Basic searching of content based on words. 
 * Voice negotiations between operators
