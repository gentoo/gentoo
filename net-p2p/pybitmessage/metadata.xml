	<longdescription lang="en">
		Bitmessage is a P2P communications protocol used to send encrypted
		messages to another person or to many subscribers. It is
		decentralized and trustless, meaning that you need-not inherently
		trust any entities like root certificate authorities. It uses
		strong authentication which means that the sender of a message
		cannot be spoofed, and it aims to hide "non-content" data, like
		the sender and receiver of messages, from passive eavesdroppers
		like those running warrantless wiretapping programs.
