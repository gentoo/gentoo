  <longdescription lang="en">
    Bitmessage is a P2P communications protocol used to send encrypted
    messages to another person or to many subscribers. It is
    decentralized and trustless, meaning that you need-not inherently
    trust any entities like root certificate authorities. It uses
    strong authentication which means that the sender of a message
    cannot be spoofed, and it aims to hide "non-content" data, like
    the sender and receiver of messages, from passive eavesdroppers
    like those running warrantless wiretapping programs.
