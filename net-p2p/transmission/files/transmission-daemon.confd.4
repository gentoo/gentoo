# This is the transmission-daemon configuration file. For other options and
# better explanation, take a look at transmission-daemon manual page Note: it's
# better to configure some settings (like username/password) in
# /var/lib/transmission/config/settings.json to avoid other users see it with `ps`

# Parameters to pass to transmission-daemon
# TRANSMISSION_OPTIONS=""

# Run daemon as another user (username or username:groupname)
# If you change this setting, chown -R /var/lib/transmission/config <and download directory, check web settings>
#runas_user=transmission

# Location of logfile (should be writeable for runas_user user)
# Set logfile=syslog to use syslog for logging
#logfile=/var/log/transmission/transmission.log
