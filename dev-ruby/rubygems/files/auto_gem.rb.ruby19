# DO NOT USE THIS FILE!
# ---------------------
# This file is a placebo for Ruby 1.9 to work with a legacy feature, Gentoo
# added to Ruby 1.8 and earlier, loading rubygems automatically (auto_gem).
# It is no longer needed, but ruby19 needs this file to operate properly on
# a system containing older versions of Ruby and thus the legacy feature.
#
# REMOVAL NOTE:
# You may remove this file if you are running a Ruby >=1.9.1 *only* system
# or have disabled the Gentoo auto_gem.rb/RUBYOPT=auto_gem magic.
