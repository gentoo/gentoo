Mutant Storm progresses over 89 levels of psychedelic 3D arenas, that get 
ever more crowded with nasty beasties. This carnival of frenetic fun is 
showcased in a cutting edge graphics extravganza.

Viewed from well above, you and your enemies can always be seen. Always be 
killed, and always be laughed at! There is no hiding. No tactics. No 
planning... No Net.
Your enemies created this world and they sure ain't gonna help you 
out!

You like to play hard? Then the game gets harder. Feel like your doing 
well? ...
Enjoy it while it lasts!

Survive long enough, and you get rewarded with score multipliers, doubling 
your score. Making your enemies even angrier, and that bit more determined 
to kill you!
Lose a life and watch your multipliers tumble, and the beasties slow down 
and relax, safe in the knowledge that you are just a big softy really!!
After you conquer all 89 levels you'll be awarded your first 
'White Belt' progressing if you can win all 8 belts until you 
have possess the much coveted Mutant Storm 'Black Belt'.

Mutant Storm is inspired the classic RoboTron by Williams, Smash TV and 
Jeff Minters fantastic Llamatron.
To those unacquainted, this means one hand controlling fire direction, and 
the other controlling movement. Sounds confusing? ...don't worry, just grab 
your trusty mouse ( or dual stick joypad if you want genuine Robotron style 
) and give it a go. Its very simple once you try, and very intuitive once 
you're used to it.
