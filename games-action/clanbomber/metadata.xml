ClanBomber is a free (GPL) Bomberman-like multiplayer game that uses ClanLib, a free multi 
platform C++ game SDK. First "ClanBomber" was only a working title for a small game started in 
September 1998, that has only been started to learn how to use ClanLib. But the ClanBomber 
project has grown into a real game. It is fully playable and features Computer controlled 
bombers, however, it is recommended to play ClanBomber with friends (3-8 players are really fun).
