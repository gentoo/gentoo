Descent 3 is a first-person 3-D action flight-sim which takes place in both indoor and outdoor arenas.  The game was ported to Linux by the now defunct Loki Entertainment and is commercial software.  You can still pick up a copy from Tuxgames (http://www.tuxgames.com), but supplies are limited, as the publisher is no longer in business.
