		Jack Black stars as Eddie Riggs, a roadie who’s sucked into a
		mythical Age of Rock to fight evil, liberate an army of headbangers
		from a life of oppression, find love, and discover his life’s
		purpose. Heavy stuff until one realizes the universe of Brütal
		Legend has sprung up from the mind of legendary game director Tim
		Schafer.

		Enter the world of Heavy Metal where mountains are made of
		amplifiers, killer spiders spin guitar strings, druids want to
		kill you, and Rock Legends roam the landscape.

		Armed with a massive battle-axe, guitar, and his hot-rod, Eddie
		will rip the faces off of demons. As Eddie, expect to crush skulls,
		ravage the road in the Deuce, and unleash the power of Heavy Metal
		to reign down fire from the sky — all to save humanity and become
		a brutal legend.
