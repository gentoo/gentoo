		by Interplay and Parallax. Descent 2 released for the PC in
		1996. It, along with its predecessor, was one of the first
		games with true 3-dimensional graphics, 6 degrees of freedom
		in movement, light sourcing, and the capability to join
		multiplayer games on-the-fly. D1X-Rebirth and DXX-Rebirth are
		modifications of the original Descent 1 and 2 sources that was
		released by Parallax (and are based on the D1X and D2X
		sources). It offering OpenGL graphics, advanced multiplayer,
		new features, and cross-platform compatibility. Now code bases
		of D1X-Rebirth and DXX-Rebirth merged and released as
		DXX-Rebirth.
