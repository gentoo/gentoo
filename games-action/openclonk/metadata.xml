		OpenClonk is the Open source successor of the Clonk gaming series.
		OpenClonk is a project dedicated to the further development of the
		Clonk game series. Our goal is to improve and make the real strengths
		of Clonk more fun to play: Bustling mining, production lines and
		economy, fast and fiddly melees. Another focus lies on the further
		enchancement of the game engine and the extensibility/modability of
		the game content with C4Script which has always been one of the most
		important features of Clonk.
