		Razputin “Raz” Aquato, trained acrobat and powerful young psychic, has
		realized his lifelong dream of joining the international psychic
		espionage organization known as the Psychonauts! But these psychic super
		spies are in trouble. Their leader hasn't been the same since he was
		rescued from a kidnapping, and what's worse, there's a mole hiding in
		headquarters.

		Combining quirky missions and mysterious conspiracies, Psychonauts 2 is
		a platform-adventure game with cinematic style and tons of customizable
		psychic powers. Psychonauts 2 serves up danger, excitement and laughs in
		equal measure as players guide Raz on a journey through the minds of
		friends and foes on a quest to defeat a murderous psychic villain.
