"Battle Tanks" is a funny battle on your desk, where you can choose one of three
vehicles and eliminate your enemy using the whole arsenal of weapons. It has
original cartoon-like graphics and cool music, it's fun and dynamic, it has
several network modes for deathmatch and cooperative --- what else is needed to
have fun with your friends? And all is packed and ready for you in "Battle
Tanks".
