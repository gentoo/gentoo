Power up your mana and help Corvus find the cure to a plague of epic dimensions -- and save the worlds of D'sparil before it's too late!  A high-powered and mystical three-dimensional environment will enthrall you, with spectacular sound and visual effects, non-stop action and adventure.  Prepare to be ensnared in the visual feast that is the worlds of D'sparil.  This is the demo version of the commercially-ported game.
