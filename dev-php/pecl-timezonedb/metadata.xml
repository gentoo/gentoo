	This extension is a drop-in replacement for the builtin timezone database that
	comes with PHP. You should only install this extension in case you need to get
	a later version of the timezone database than the one that ships with PHP.
	
	The data that this extension uses comes from the "Olson" database, which is
	located at ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/.
