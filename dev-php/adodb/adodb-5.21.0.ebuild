# If you want to be picky, we should require that PHP be built with at
# least one database driver enabled; otherwise adodb isn't going to be
# able to do anything. But, the database USE flags for dev-lang/php are
# a mess. What we would *like* to do is have a set of USE flags for
# adodb that then propagate to PHP itself... for example, adodb[mysql]
# could require php[mysql]. To do that would require that we duplicate
# the database USE flag mess for adodb -- not desirable. Instead we punt
# and let the user install adodb unconditionally. If he doesn't have
# database support in PHP, it just won't work.
