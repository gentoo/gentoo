# To help out the Composer children, the tests and examples are missing
# from the release tarballs.
IUSE="doc idn ssl"

# The ctype and filter extensions get used unconditionally, with no
# fallback and no "extension missing" exception. All of the other
# extensions are technically optional, depending on how you use
# PHPMailer and whether or not you're willing to settle for fallback
# implementations.
#
# The insane dependency string is to prevent the ctype and filter
# extensions from being provided by one version (i.e. slot) of PHP,
# while intl and unicode are provided by another.
