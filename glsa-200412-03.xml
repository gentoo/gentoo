  <synopsis>
    Multiple overflows have been found in the imlib library image decoding
    routines, potentially allowing execution of arbitrary code.

    <p>
    imlib is an advanced replacement library for image manipulation
    libraries like libXpm. It is called by numerous programs, including
    gkrellm and several window managers, to help in displaying images.

    Pavel Kankovsky discovered that several overflows found in the
    libXpm library (see GLSA 200409-34) also applied to imlib. He also
    fixed a number of other potential flaws.

  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could entice a user to view a carefully-crafted
    image file, which would potentially lead to execution of arbitrary code
    with the rights of the user viewing the image. This affects any program
    that makes use of the imlib library.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All imlib users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=media-libs/imlib-1.9.14-r3"</code>
  </resolution>
