sync2cd is an incremental archiving tool. It allows backing up complete filesystem hierarchies to multiple backup 
media (e.g. CD-R). Files are archived incrementally, i.e. only new or changed files are stored during an archive 
operation.

All entity types are supported: directories, files, symlinks, named pipes, sockets, block and character devices.
