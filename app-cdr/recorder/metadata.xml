    Recorder is a graphical frontend of cdrecord/cdrtools, cdrdao, mkisofs
    and growisofs. It aims to be simple and easy to use, free of large
    configurations and useless options, following the KISS principle and
    offering a disc burning of quality, nothing more. You can burn data
    (CD/DVD), audio (CD), video (DVD, VCD and SVCD), iso images (CD/DVD),
    create iso images to burn later and check integrity of burned files
    with md5sum.
