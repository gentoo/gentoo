# This is here to serve as a note to myself, and future developers.
#
# Any Display manager (gdm,kdm,xdm) has the following problem:  if
# it is started before any getty, and no vt is specified, it will
# usually run on vt2.  When the getty on vt2 then starts, and the
# DM is already started, the getty will take control of the keyboard,
# leaving us with a "dead" keyboard.
#
# Resolution: add the following line to /etc/inittab
#
#  x:a:once:/usr/bin/startDM
#
# and have /usr/bin/startDM start the DM in daemon mode if
# a lock is present (with the info of what DM should be started),
# else just fall through.
#
# How this basically works, is the "a" runlevel is a additional
# runlevel that you can use to fork processes with init, but the
# runlevel never gets changed to this runlevel. Along with the "a"
# runlevel, the "once" key word means that startDM will only be
# run when we specify it to run, thus eliminating respawning
# startDM when "display-manager" is not added to the default 
# runlevel, as was done previously.
#
# This script then just calls "telinit a", and init will run
# /usr/bin/startDM after the current runlevel completes (this
# script should only be added to the actual runlevel the user is
# using).
