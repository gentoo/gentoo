We created a configuration file for tor, /etc/tor/torrc, but you can
change it according to your needs.  Use the torrc.sample that is in
that directory as a guide.  Also, to have privoxy work with tor
just add the following line

forward-socks4a / localhost:9050 .

to /etc/privoxy/config.  Notice the . at the end!
