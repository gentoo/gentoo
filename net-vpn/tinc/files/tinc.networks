# file: /etc/conf.d/tinc.networks for /etc/init.d/tincd
 
# In this file you define the tinc networks you want to connect to

# USAGE:
# you add a network to the init script by defining:
# NETWORK: your_network_name
#
# if you want to connect to multiple VPN's just set them behind each other. e.g.
# NETWORK: foo
# NETWORK: bar
# 
# this would join the network foo and the network bar.
