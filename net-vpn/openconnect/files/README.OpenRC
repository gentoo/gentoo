The service script for openconnect supports multiple VPN tunnels.

To enable this, create a symbolic link to /etc/init.d/openconnect in
/etc/init.d for each tunnel instead of calling it directly:

ln -s /etc/init.d/openconnect /etc/init.d/openconnect.vpn0

To define per-VPN settings, copy /etc/conf.d/openconnect to
openconnect.vpn0.

You can then start the vpn tunnel like this:

rc-service openconnect.vpn0 start
