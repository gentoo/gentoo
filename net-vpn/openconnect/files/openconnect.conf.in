# Variables to configure vpn tunnels where "vpnname" is the name of your vpn tunnel:
#
# server_vpnname
# password_vpnname
# vpnopts_vpnname
#
# The tunnel will need to be started with a symbolic link to openconnect:
#
# ln -s /etc/init.d/openconnect /etc/init.d/openconnect.vpnname
#
# If you'd like to execute a script on preup, postup, predown and postdown of the vpn tunnel, you
# need to create executable scripts in a directory with the same name as
# the vpn tunnel (vpn0 can be replaced with the vpn name):
#
# mkdir /etc/openconnect/vpn0
# cd /etc/openconnect/vpn0"
# echo '#!/bin/sh' > preup.sh"
# cp preup.sh predown.sh"
# cp preup.sh postup.sh"
# cp preup.sh postdown.sh"
# chmod 755 /etc/openconnect/vpn0/*"

server_vpn0="vpn.server.tld"
password_vpn0="YOUR_PASSWORD"
# Any OPENCONNECT options my go here (see openconnect --help)
vpnopts_vpn0="-l --passwd-on-stdin --user=YOUR_USERNAME --script=/etc/openconnect/openconnect.sh"
