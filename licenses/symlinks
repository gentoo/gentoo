Subject: symlinks utility: license policy

Hi,

My "symlinks" utility pre-dates the "open source licensing" fad
by a number of years.  Just to clarify, this is 100% freeware,
written entirely by myself.  The intent is to use it to detect
missing/obsolete symlink targets on an installed distro, before
creating the "gold" (or "final") release discs.

Use and distribute and modify as you (or anyone else) sees fit.
There have no formal restrictions or requirements whatsoever
regarding distribution of either binaries or source code,
whether modified or original.

Cheers
