            “LogMeIn Marks”), and any related intellectual property rights,
            including, without limitation, all modifications, enhancements,
            derivative works, and upgrades thereto. You agree that you will not

   2. ORDERS, FEES AND PAYMENT.
          o 2.1.Orders. You may order Services using our then-current ordering
            processes (“Order”). All Orders are effective on the earlier of
            (i) the date you submit your Order, (ii) the date you convert from
            a services trial, or (iii)the date on the signature block of the
            Order (“Effective Date”). Acceptance of your Order may be
            subject to our verification and credit approval process. Each Order

            Order is required for non-credit card transactions over 10,000 USD,
            or equivalent, unless Customer does not require a Purchase Order as
            part of its purchasing process.
          o 2.2.Fees and Payment. You agree to pay all applicable, undisputed
            fees for the Services as set forth on the invoice. Except as set
            forth in Section 3. 3below, any and all payments you make to us for
            access to the Services are final and non-refundable. You are
            responsible for all fees and charges imposed by your voice and data
            transmission providers related to your access and use of the
            Services. You are responsible for providing accurate and current
            billing, contact and payment information to us or any reseller. You
            agree that we may take steps to verify whether your payment method
            is valid, charge your payment card or bill you for all amounts due
            for your use of the Services, and automatically update your payment
            card information using software designed to do so in the event your
            payment card on file is no longer valid. You agree that your credit
            card information and related personal data may be provided to third
            parties for payment processing and fraud prevention purposes. We

            that your payment information is inaccurate or not current, and you
            are responsible for fees and overdraft charges that we may incur
            when we charge your card for payment. We will not agree to submit
            invoices via any customer procure-to-pay online portal or

            promotions and other special discounted pricing offers are
            temporary and, upon the renewal of your subscription, any such
            discounted pricing offers may expire. We reserve the right to
            discontinue or modify any coupons, credits, sales and special
            promotional offers in our sole discretion.
          o 2.4. Disputes; Delinquent Accounts. You must notify us of any fee
            dispute within 15 days of the invoice date, and once resolved, you
            agree to pay those fees within 15 days. We may also suspend or
            terminate your Services if you do not pay undisputed fees, and you
            agree to reimburse us for all reasonable costs and expenses
            incurred in collecting delinquent amounts.

            Services, except those Taxes based on our net income, or Taxes for
            which you have provided an exemption certificate. We reserve the
            right to gross up the price for Services in any invoice, or require
            you to gross up your payment, if your withholding obligations
            prevent us from receiving the amount specified in the Order.
            Additionally, if you do not satisfy your Tax obligations, you agree
            that you will be required to reimburse us for any Taxes paid on
            your behalf, and we may take steps to collect Taxes we have paid on
            your behalf. In all cases, you will pay the amounts due under this
            Agreement to us in full without any right of set-off or deduction.
   3. TERM AND TERMINATION.
          o 3.1. Term.  Your initial term commitment for any Order (“Initial
            Term”) will be specified in the Order, or if no term is
            specified, your Initial Term will be 12 months from the Effective
            Date of the Order and will automatically renew for additional 12
            month periods (“Renewal Terms”), unless either party provides
            notice of non-renewal of the Order 30 days before the current term
            expires. We may agree to align the invoicing under multiple Orders
            but this will not reduce the term of any Order. Terminating
            specific Services does not affect the term of any other Services
            still in effect. If we permit you to reinstate Services at any time
            after termination, you agree that you will be bound by the then-
            current Terms and the renewal date that was in effect as of the
            effective termination date.
          o 3.2. Termination for Cause.Either party may terminate the Agreement
            (i)if the other party breaches its material obligations and fails
            to cure within 30 days of receipt of written notice, or (ii) if the
            other party becomes insolvent or bankrupt, liquidated or is
            dissolved, or ceases substantially all of its business, and we may
            suspend access or terminate immediately if you breach
            Section 1.2, 4 or 5.
          o 3.3. Effect of Termination. If the Agreement or any Services are
            terminated, you will immediately discontinue all use of the
            terminated Services, except that upon request, we will provide you
            with limited access to the Services for a period not to exceed 30
            days, solely to enable you to retrieve your Content from the
            Services. We have no obligation to maintain your Content after that
            period. Neither party will be liable for any damages resulting from
            termination of the Agreement, and termination will not affect any
            claim arising prior to the effective termination date. If we
            discontinue Services in accordance with Section 1.3 above, the
            related Order will be terminated and we will provide you with a pro
            rata refund of any prepaid, unused fees. You agree to pay for any
            use of the Services past the date of expiration or termination.
          o 3.4. Survival. The provisions of Sections 2 (Orders, Fees and
            Payment), 3.3 (Effect of Termination), 4 (Your Content and
            Accounts), 7 (Indemnification), 8 (Limitation on Liability), 9.6
            (No Class Actions), and 9.11 (Notices) survive any termination of
            the Agreement.

            right to grant us the license, and (ii) none of your Content
            infringes on the rights of any third party. Each party agrees to

            controller), we will use and process your Content in order to
            provide the Services and fulfill our obligations under the

          o 9.8.High-Risk Use. You understand that the Services (i) are not
            designed or intended for use during high-risk activities, and (ii)
            do not allow and should not be used for calls to emergency services
            numbers (e.g., 911 (U.S.), or 999 and 112 (UK)). WE ARE NOT A
            "DIAL-TONE" PROVIDER. IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY WHILE USING ANY
            SERVICES, HANG UP AND DIAL YOUR LOCAL EMERGENCY NUMBER. YOU MUST
            UTILIZE THE TELEPHONE SERVICE PROVIDED BY YOUR LOCAL CARRIER TO
            MAKE AN EMERGENCY CALL.
          o 9.9.Recording.  Certain Services provide functionality that allows
            you to record audio and data shared during sessions. You are solely
            responsible for complying with all applicable laws in the relevant
            jurisdictions while using recording functionality. We disclaim all
            liability for your recording of audio or shared data, and you agree
            to hold us harmless from damages or liabilities related to the
            recording of any audio or data.
          o 9.10. Assignment. Neither party may assign its rights or delegate
            its duties under the Agreement either in whole or in part without
            the other party’s prior written consent, which shall not be
            unreasonably withheld, except that either party may assign the
            Agreement to an affiliated entity, or as part of a corporate
            reorganization, consolidation, merger, or sale of all or
            substantially all of its assets. Any attempted assignment without
            consent will be void. The Agreement will bind and inure to the
            benefit of each party’s successors or assigns.
          o 9.11.Notices. Notices must be sent by personal delivery, overnight
            courier or registered mail. We may also provide notice to the email
            last designated on your account, electronically via postings on our
            website, in-product notices, or our self-service portal or
            administrative center. Unless specified elsewhere in this
            Agreement, notices should be sent to us at the address for your
            applicable contracting entity, with a copy to our Legal Department,
            320 Summer Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210 USA, and we will
            send notices to the address last designated on your account. Notice
            is given (a) upon personal delivery; (b) for overnight courier, on
            the second business day after notice is sent, (c) for registered or
            certified mail, on the fifth business day after notice is sent, (d)
            for email, when the email is sent, or (e) if posted electronically,
            upon posting.
          o 9.12.Entire Agreement; Order of Precedence. The Agreement,
            including your Order and related invoices for Services ordered,
            these Terms, Service Descriptions, and a DPA if applicable, sets
            forth the entire agreement between us relating to the Services and
            supersedes all prior and contemporaneous oral and written
            agreements, except as otherwise permitted. If there is a conflict
            between an executed Order, these Terms, the DPA if applicable, and
            the Service Descriptions, the conflict will be resolved in that
            order, but only for the specific Services described in the
            applicable Order. Nothing contained in any document submitted by
            you will add to or otherwise modify the Agreement. We may update
            the Terms from time to time, which will be identified by the last
            updated date, and may be reviewed at Terms_of_Service. Your
            continued access to and use of the Service constitutes your
            acceptance of the then-current Terms.
          o 9.13.General Terms. If any term of this Agreement is not
            enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. Both parties are
            independent contractors and nothing in this Agreement creates a
            partnership, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between
            the parties. No person or entity not a party to the Agreement will
            be a third party beneficiary. Our authorized distributors do not
            have the right to modify the Agreement or to make commitments
            binding on us. Failure to enforce any right under the Agreement
            will not waive that right. Unless otherwise specified, remedies are
            cumulative. The Agreement may be agreed to online, or executed by
            electronic signature and in one or more counterparts. No party will
            be responsible for any delay or failure to perform under the
            Agreement due to force majeure events (e.g. natural disasters;
            terrorist activities, activities of third party service providers,
            labor disputes; and acts of government) and acts beyond a party’s
            reasonable control, but only for so long as those conditions
            persist.
          o 9.14.Contracting Party, Choice of Law and Location for
            ResolvingDisputes. The contracting entity, contact information, and
            governing law for your use of the Services will depend on where you
            are and the specific Services you have ordered, as set forth here:
