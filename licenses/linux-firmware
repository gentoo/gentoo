Gentoo license note:

Linux firmware images are distributed under a variety of licenses,
many of them being non-free. Most likely, upstream redistribution of
some firmware images may conflict with the licenses or lack thereof on
the images. You will need to check the WHENCE and LICEN[CS]E.* files
in the package for specific licensing terms.
