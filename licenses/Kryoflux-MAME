- Aforementioned modifications to the code can be made to enhance the code or to make it compile on other platforms than originally supported. Modifications must still satisfy the Purpose. Any file formats other than those listed under Purpose must not be enabled through the SPS DECODER LIBRARY.

COMMON QUESTIONS

Q. Can I include the SPS DECODER LIBRARY with my commercial product?
A. No. The SPS DECODER LIBRARY is not licensed for commercial use. Using SPS DECODER LIBRARY as a "freebie" or including it at "no cost" with your product still constitutes commerical usage and is forbidden by the licence.

Q. Can I sell my product with the SPS DECODER LIBRARY or associated logos (e.g. SPS, KryoFlux) on it?
A. No. Putting the name or logo on your product makes it appear that the product is something officially endorsed.

Q. Can I use the SPS DECODER LIBRARY or the SPS logo to advertise my product?
A. No. Using the name or logo in your advertising makes it appear that the product is something officially endorsed.

Q. Can I use the term "SPS DECODER LIBRARY" in the name of my software?
A. Generally, no, especially if it is something that is sold. However, if you are producing a free SPS DECODER LIBRARY-related piece of software, it is common that permission is granted. Send a query to double-check first, please.

Q. Can I ask for donations for the work I did on my port of SPS DECODER LIBRARY to platform X?
A. No. You would be earning money from the SPS DECODER LIBRARY trademark and copyrights, and that would be a commercial use, which is prohibited by the licence. It is our wish that SPS DECODER LIBRARY remains free.
