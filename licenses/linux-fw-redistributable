Gentoo license note:

Linux firmware images are distributed under a variety of licenses,
many of them being non-free. However, all images whose license is
subsumed under this license label should at least be redistributable.
You will need to check the WHENCE and LICEN[CS]E.* files in the
package for specific licensing terms.
