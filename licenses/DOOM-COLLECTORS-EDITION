Subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement and so long as you fully comply at all times with this Agreement, ID grants to you the non-exclusive and limited right to create for the Software (except any Software code) your own modifications (the "New Creations") which shall operate only with the Software (but not any demo, test or other version of the Software).  ID reserves all rights not granted in this Agreement, including, without limitation, all rights to ID's trademarks. You may include within the New Creations certain textures and other images (the "ID Images") from the Software.

You shall not rent, sell, lease, lend, offer on a pay-per-play basis or otherwise commercially exploit or commercially distribute the New Creations.

this Agreement shall automatically terminate, without notice.

7. Limited Activision Warranty.  Activision warrants to the original consumer purchaser of the Software that the recording medium on which the Software is recorded will be free from defects in material and workmanship for 90 days from the date of purchase.  If the recording medium is found defective within 90 days of original purchase, Activision agrees to replace, free of charge, any Software discovered to be defective within such period upon its receipt of the Software, postage paid, with the proof of the date of purchase, as long as the Software is still being manufactured by Activision.  In the event that the Software is no longer available, Activision retains the right to substitute a similar game program of equal or greater value.  This warranty is limited to the recording medium containing the Software as originally provided by Activision and is not applicable to normal wear and tear. This warranty shall not be applicable and shall be void if the
defect has arisen through abuse, mistreatment or neglect.

EXCEPT AS SET FORTH ABOVE, THIS WARRANTY IS IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT, AND NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR CLAIMS OF ANY KIND SHALL BE BINDING ON OR OBLIGATE ACTIVISION.

8. Governing Law, Venue, and Liability Limitation.  This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the applicable laws of the State of Texas and applicable United States federal law.  Copyright and other proprietary matters will be governed by applicable United States laws and international treaties.  Except as set forth below, exclusive venue for all litigation regarding this Agreement shall be in Dallas County, Texas and you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts in Dallas, Texas for any such litigation. Exclusive venue for all litigation involving Activision, but not involving ID, with regard to this Agreement shall be in Los Angeles County, California and you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts in Los Angeles, California for any such litigation.  You agree that your unauthorized use of the ID Images, the Printed Materials, or the Software, or any part thereof, may immediately and irreparably damage ID such that ID
could not be adequately compensated solely by a monetary award and that at ID's option ID shall be entitled to an injunctive order, in addition to all other available remedies including a monetary award, appropriately restraining and/or prohibiting such unauthorized use without the necessity of ID posting bond or other security.   

IN ANY CASE, ID, ACTIVISION, AND ID'S AND ACTIVISION'S RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, LICENSEES (EXCLUDING YOU), SUBLICENSEES (EXCLUDING YOU), SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES ARISING FROM ANY ALLEGED CLAIM FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT PRODUCT  LIABILITY, OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY EVEN IF ID, ACTIVISION OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENT(S) HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE, OR LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER
PARTY.  Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.  This section 8. shall survive the cancellation or termination of this Agreement.

9. U.S. Government Restricted Rights.  To the extent applicable, the United States Government shall only have those rights to use the Software and the Printed Materials as expressly stated and expressly limited and restricted in this Agreement, as provided in 48 C.F.R. ยงยง 227.7201 through 227.7204, inclusive.

10. General Provisions.  Neither this Agreement nor any part or portion hereof shall be assigned or sublicensed by you.  ID and Activision each may assign its respective rights under this Agreement in the assigning party's sole discretion.  Should any provision of this Agreement be held to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity and enforceability of the other provisions shall not be affected thereby.  If any provision is determined to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, you agree to a modification of such provision to provide for enforcement of the provision's intent, to the extent permitted by applicable law.  Failure of ID or Activision to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute or be construed as a waiver of such provision or of the right to enforce such provision.  Immediately upon your failure to comply with or breach of any term or provision of this Agreement, 
YOUR LICENSE AND THIS AGREEMENT SHALL AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATE, WITHOUT NOTICE,  AND ID AND ACTIVISION MAY PURSUE ALL RELIEF AND REMEDIES AGAINST YOU WHICH ARE AVAILABLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW AND/OR THIS AGREEMENT.  In the event this Agreement is terminated, you shall have no right to use the Software, the Printed Materials or the New Creations, in any manner, and you shall immediately destroy all copies of the Software, the Printed Materials and the New Creations in your possession, custody or control.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THIS AGREEMENT, AND UNDERSTAND THAT BY CONTINUING THE INSTALLATION OF THE SOFTWARE, BY LOADING OR RUNNING THE SOFTWARE, OR BY PLACING OR COPYING THE SOFTWARE ONTO YOUR COMPUTER HARD DRIVE OR RAM, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT, EXCEPT FOR WRITTEN SEPARATE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN ID, ACTIVISION AND YOU, IF ANY, THIS AGREEMENT IS A COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE STATEMENT OF THE RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES OF THE PARTIES HERETO.  THIS AGREEMENT SUPERSEDES ALL PRIOR ORAL AGREEMENTS, PROPOSALS OR UNDERSTANDINGS, AND ANY OTHER COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN ID, ACTIVISION AND YOU RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT.
