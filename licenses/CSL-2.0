I. Terms for redistribution of original source and binaries

Redistribution and use of unmodified source and/or binaries are
permitted provided that the following condition is met:

1. Redistributions of original source code must retain the above
   copyright notice and license.  You are not required to redistribute
   the original source; you may choose to redistribute only the
   binaries.

Basically, if you distribute unmodified source, you meet
automatically comply with the license with no additional effort on
your part.

II. Terms for distribution of derived works via subclassing and/or
    composition.

You may generate derived works by means of subclassing and/or
composition (e.g., the Adaptor Pattern), provided that the following
conditions are met:

1. Redistributions of original source code must retain the above
   copyright notice and license.  You are not required to redistribute
   the original source; you may choose to redistribute only the
   binaries.

2. The original software is not altered.

3. Derived works are not contained in the info.clearthought
   namespace/package or any subpackage of info.clearthought.

4. Derived works do not use the class or interface names from the
   info.clearthought... packages

For example, you may define a class with the following full name:
   org.nameOfMyOrganization.layouts.RowMajorTableLayout

However, you may not define a class with the either of the
following full names:
   info.clearthought.layout.RowMajorTableLayout
   org.nameOfMyOrganization.layouts.TableLayout

III. Terms for redistribution of source modified via patch files.

You may generate derived works by means of patch files provided
that the following conditions are met:

1. Redistributions of original source code must retain the above
   copyright notice and license.  You are not required to
   redistribute the original source; you may choose to redistribute
   only the binaries resulting from the patch files.

2. The original source files are not altered.  All alteration is
   done in patch files.

3. Derived works are not contained in the info.clearthought
   namespace/package or any subpackage of info.clearthought.  This
   means that your patch files must change the namespace/package
   for the derived work.  See section II for examples.

4. Derived works do not use the class or interface names from the
   info.clearthought... packages.  This means your patch files
   must change the names of the interfaces and classes they alter.
   See section II for examples.

5. Derived works must include the following disclaimer.
   "This work is derived from Clearthought's TableLayout,
    https://tablelayout.dev.java.net, by means of patch files
    rather than subclassing or composition.  Therefore, this work
    might not contain the latest fixes and features of TableLayout."

IV. Terms for repackaging, transcoding, and compiling of binaries.

You may do any of the following with the binaries of the
original software.

1. You may move binaries (.class files) from the original .jar file
   to your own .jar file.

2. You may move binaries from the original .jar file to other
   resource containing files, including but not limited to .zip,
   .gz, .tar, .dll, .exe files.

3. You may backend compile the binaries to any platform, including
   but not limited to Win32, Win64, MAC OS, Linux, Palm OS, any
   handheld or embedded platform.

4. You may transcribe the binaries to other virtual machine byte
   code protocols, including but not limited to .NET.
