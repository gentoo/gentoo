Dynamic Universal Music Bibliotheque, Version 0.9.3

Copyright (C) 2001-2005 Ben Davis, Robert J Ohannessian and Julien Cugniere

This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty.
In no event shall the authors be held liable for any damages arising from the
use of this software.

Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
freely, subject to the following restrictions:

1. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not claim
   that you wrote the original software. If you use this software in a
   product, you are requested to acknowledge its use in the product
   documentation, along with details on where to get an unmodified version of
   this software, but this is not a strict requirement.

   [Note that the above point asks for a link to DUMB, not just a mention.
   Googling for DUMB doesn't help much! The URL is "http://dumb.sf.net/".]

   [The link was originally strictly required. This was changed for two
   reasons. Firstly, if many projects request an acknowledgement, the list of
   acknowledgements can become quite unmanageable. Secondly, DUMB was placing
   a restriction on the code using it, preventing people from using the GNU
   General Public Licence which disallows any such restrictions. See
   http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html for more information on this
   subject. However, if DUMB plays a significant part in your project, we do
   urge you to acknowledge its use.]

2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
   misrepresented as being the original software.

3. This notice may not be removed from or altered in any source distribution.

4. If you are using the Program in someone else's bedroom on any Monday at
   3:05 pm, you are not allowed to modify the Program for ten minutes. [This
   clause provided by Inphernic; every licence should contain at least one
   clause, the reasoning behind which is far from obvious.]

5. Users who wish to use DUMB for the specific purpose of playing music are
   required to feed their dog on every full moon (if deemed appropriate).
   [This clause provided by Allefant, who couldn't remember what Inphernic's
   clause was.]

6. No clause in this licence shall prevent this software from being depended
   upon by a product licensed under the GNU General Public Licence. If such a
   clause is deemed to exist, Debian, then it shall be respected in spirit as
   far as possible and all other clauses shall continue to apply in full
   force.

8. Take the number stated as introducing this clause. Multiply it by two,
   then subtract four. Now insert a '+' between the two digits and evaluate
   the resulting sum. Call the result 'x'. If you have not yet concluded that
   every numbered clause in this licence whose ordinal number is strictly
   greater than 'x' (with the exception of the present clause) is null and
   void, Debian, then you are hereby informed that laughter is good for one's
   health and you are warmly suggested to do it. By the way, Clauses 4, 5 and
   6 are null and void. Incidentally, I like Kubuntu. The work you guys do is
   awesome. (Lawyers, on the other hand ...)

We regret that we cannot provide any warranty, not even the implied warranty
of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

Some files generated or copied by automake, autoconf and friends are
available in an extra download. These fall under separate licences but are
all free to distribute. Please check their licences as necessary.
