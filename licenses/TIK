10. GENERAL.  
a. Law. This License Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of law provisions.  The parties hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New York State, waive any right to object to said jurisdiction based upon convenience or other bases, and further agree that any cause of action arising under this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in a court in New York County. 
b. Entire Agreement. This License Agreement shall constitute the entire Agreement between the parties hereto.  Any waiver or modification of this License Agreement shall only be effective if it is in writing and signed by both parties hereto.  
c. No Waiver.  No waiver of any provision hereof or of any right or remedy hereunder shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced. No delay in exercising, no course of dealing with respect to, or no partial exercise of any right or remedy hereunder shall constitute a waiver of any other right or remedy, or future exercise thereof. 
d. Severability. If any part of this License Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, in order to achieve the intent of the parties to the extent possible, and the enforceability of the remaining provisions shall be unimpaired.  
e. Limitations. No action, regardless of form, arising out of this Agreement may be brought by you more than two (2) years after such cause of action shall have accrued.  
f. Assignment. You may not assign, sublicense, transfer, pledge, lease, rent or share your rights under this License Agreement.  TIK may assign or delegate this Agreement or any right or obligation hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, to any entity.
g. Dispute Resolution Process. Should a dispute arise between the parties under or relating to this Agreement, you agree to notify TIK in writing as promptly as possible of any such dispute, including any dispute as to whether an event of default has occurred, and each party agrees that prior to initiating any formal proceeding against the other (except for the seeking of injunctive relief), the parties will each designate a representative for purposes of resolving this dispute.  If the parties' representatives are unable to resolve the dispute within ten (10) business days, either may, upon written notice to the other party, require that the dispute be submitted to more senior representatives within each party (the "Senior Representatives").  The Senior Representatives of each party shall meet as soon as possible to negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute.  If the Senior Representatives are unable to resolve the dispute within ten (10) business days after submission of the dispute to them, or such longer period for resolution as may be mutually agreed in writing by the Senior Representatives, the dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration administered by and under the then-current rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA").  The location of any such proceeding shall be New York, New York.  Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof.  Any arbitrator shall be bound by the express terms of this Agreement and shall not change or modify any terms of this Agreement or make any award of damages in excess of that set forth in this Agreement or grant any relief not expressly set forth herein.

h. Survival.  The respective rights and obligations of the parties with respect to Section 2 [Ownership], Section 5 [Disclaimer of Warranty], Section 6 [Limitation of Liability], Section 8 [Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure], and this Section 9 [General Provisions] shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement. 

i. Remedies.  The rights and remedies of the parties as set forth in this Agreement are not exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies available to them in law or in equity.

11. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS.  The Software (including the Documentation) is provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS.  Use, duplication, or disclosure by the Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software clause of DFARS 252.227-7013 [Rights in Technical Data - Non-Commercial Items] or subparagraph (c)(1) and (2) of the Commercial Computer Software-Restricted Rights clause at 48 CFR 52.227-19 as amended, or any successor regulations thereto.
