BETWEEN YOU AND ORACLE.

ORACLE AMERICA, INC. ("ORACLE") IS WILLING TO LICENSE THE PRODUCT DEFINED
IN SECTION 1 BELOW ONLY ON THE CONDITION THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS
CONTAINED IN THIS VIRTUALBOX EXTENSION PACK PERSONAL USE AND EVALUATION
LICENSE AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT").

IF YOU ARE AGREEING TO THIS LICENSE ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY (RATHER THAN
AS AN INDIVIDUAL HUMAN BEING), YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE APPROPRIATE
AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ON BEHALF OF SUCH ENTITY.

1 SUBJECT OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement governs your use of the binary
software package called "Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack" (the
"Product"), which contains a set of additional features for "Oracle
VM VirtualBox" that enhance the operation of multiple virtual machines
("Guest Computers") on a single physical computer ("Host Computer"). The
Product consists of executable files in machine code, script files,
data files, and all documentation and updates provided to You by Oracle.

2 GRANT OF LICENSE. Oracle grants you a personal, non-exclusive,
non-transferable, limited license without fees to reproduce, install,
execute, and use internally the Product on Host Computers for
your Personal Use, Educational Use, or Evaluation. "Personal Use"
is noncommercial use solely by the person downloading the Product
from Oracle on a single Host Computer, provided that no more than one
client or remote computer is connected to that Host Computer and that
client or remote computer is used solely to remotely view the Guest
Computer(s). "Educational Use" is any use by teachers or students in
an academic institution (schools, colleges and universities) as part of
the institution's educational curriculum. "Evaluation" means testing the
Product for up to thirty (30) days; after expiry of that term, you are
no longer permitted to use the Product. Personal Use and/or Educational
Use expressly exclude any use of the Product for commercial purposes or
to operate, run, or act on behalf of or for the benefit of a business,
organization, governmental organization, or educational institution.

Oracle reserves all rights not expressly granted in this license.

3 RESTRICTIONS AND RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.

(1) The Product and copies thereof provided to you under this Agreement
are copyrighted and licensed, not sold, to you by Oracle.

(2) You may not do any of the following: (a) modify any part of the
Product, except to the extent allowed in the documentation accompanying
the Product; (b) rent, lease, lend, re-distribute, or encumber the

of fitness for such uses.

(4) No right, title or interest in or to any trademark, service mark, logo
or trade name of Oracle or its licensors is granted under this Agreement.

4 TERMINATION. The Agreement is effective on the date you receive the
Product and remains effective until terminated. Your rights under this
Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Oracle if
you materially breach it or take any action in derogation of Oracle's
and/or its licensors' rights to the Product. Oracle may terminate this
Agreement immediately should any part of the Product become or in Oracle's
reasonable opinion likely to become the subject of a claim of intellectual
property infringement or trade secret misappropriation. Upon termination,
you will cease use of and destroy all copies of the Product under your
control and confirm compliance in writing to Oracle. Sections 3-9,
inclusive, will survive termination of the Agreement.

5 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
ORACLE PROVIDES THE PRODUCT "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, ORACLE SPECIFICALLY
DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. The entire risk as
to the quality and performance of the Product is with you. Should it
prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair,
or correction.

6 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
IN NO EVENT WILL ORACLE OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE,
PROFIT, DATA, OR DATA USE, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY
OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO
USE THE PRODUCT, EVEN IF ORACLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Oracle's liability to you, whether in
contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount
paid by you for the Product under this Agreement.

7 SEPARATELY LICENSED THIRD PARTY TECHNOLOGY. The Product may contain
or require the use of third party technology that is provided with
the Product. Oracle may provide certain notices to you in the Product's
documentation, readmes or notice files in connection with such third party
technology. Third party technology will be licensed to you either under
the terms of this Agreement or, if specified in the documentation, readmes
or notice files, under Separate Terms. Your rights to use Separately
Licensed Third Party Technology under Separate Terms are not restricted
in any way by this Agreement. However, for clarity, notwithstanding the
existence of a notice, third party technology that is not Separately
Licensed Third Party Technology shall be deemed part of the Product and
is licensed to You under the terms of this Agreement. "Separate Terms"
refers to separate license terms that are specified in the Product's
documentation, readmes or notice files and that apply to Separately
Licensed Third Party Technology. "Separately Licensed Third Party

10 MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement is the entire agreement between you
and Oracle relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, representations
and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms
of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other communication between
the parties relating to its subject matter during the term of this
Agreement. No modification of this Agreement will be binding, unless in
writing and signed by an authorized representative of each party. If any
provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this Agreement
will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless omission would
frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this Agreement will
immediately terminate. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the
State of California, USA, and you and Oracle agree to submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in, the courts of San Francisco
