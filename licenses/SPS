The Software Preservation Society ("SPS")
Licence Agreement (Licence, Copyright and Terms of Use)

SPS technology is exclusively represented and licensed by
KryoFlux Products & Services Limited, 80 Allington Way, Maidstone,
ME16 0HN, United Kingdom


ATTENTION: READ CAREFULLY: By using, copying, or distributing the
accompanying software you indicate your acceptance of the following
SPS Licence Agreement ("Agreement").


PREAMBLE

The SPS philosophy dictates that the technology associated with capturing
floppy disk based software should be provided to "the community" for free
(free as in "free beer") to the greatest extent possible in order to
facilitate digital preservation efforts.

This licence enforces that philosophy. It protects against misuse of
a technology that has been a long time in development and is provided
to the community or anyone else who would like to use it. It also
intends to protect SPS itself from possible legal liability.


SPS technology covered by this license can be divided into two categories:

KRYOFLUX HIGH DEFINITION FLUX SAMPLER FOR USB: Preservation starts at
the ingestion level. SPS therefore has developed a combination of hard
and software targeted at software preservation called KryoFlux. KryoFlux
software may be used for private, non-commercial purposes only. KryoFlux
hardware schematics are provided for private, non-commercial use as well.
Therefore private users can decide to build a KryoFlux board on their own,
as long as the board is used for private purposes only and as long as such
boards are not being sold to others (this includes boards given away for
any kind of compensation). Licenses for commercial, government or academic
use of KryoFlux can be applied for by contacting us at the email at the
bottom of this license.

CTA SOFTWARE PRESERVATION ANALYSER: This product is the core of SPS
technology and is under constant development since 2001. The Analyser
is used by SPS internally and also available as a commercial product for
institutes, libraries, archives and museums. The Analyser is not free, it
is commercial software. This means that possession or distribution without
a proper licence is breach of international copyright treaties.


The IPF support library is covered by a separate license and is
specifically excluded from the terms laid out in this license, available
in the IPF support library distribution.


You may notice that this licence is very strict in pursuit of getting
the software into the hands of people who wish to use it for free. You
can not distribute it without written permission, charge to give it to
somebody, not even for media costs. You cannot have it on a CD ROM that is
distributed for payment. You cannot use it as part of providing a service
that receives payment in any form.

Any source provided (if any) is for inspection, understanding and
safe keeping only. This will ensure that data capture or stored with
SPS technology can still be accessed in the future even if there is
no successor or representative of SPS available.

Infringement of any of the terms of this licence is breaching
international copyright laws, but it also hurts the communities
benefiting from the technology by risking its future improvement
and availability.

This licence was not produced for the fun of it, you should note that
only those who could possibly benefit financially are being restricted.
Those people should negotiate an alternative license, which helps fund
future development and our preservation activities.

If you do not agree with any of the terms in this licence for the
Technology then you are obviously free to choose not to use it.

It is very easy to comply with this licence: Do not sell, modify or
abuse the software and don't steal code from source provided. Learn,
understand and write your own if you need to. Feel free to ask if you
want to use something you can not create on your own. That's it.
Everything else mentioned is here for those who may not understand
these simple rules.


1. CLARIFICATION. The software product and accompanying documentation
   (the program's object code, source code and documentation, explicitly

   "Technology") is a technology and does not imply any restrictions,
   warranty, licence, obligation or any other link or association with
