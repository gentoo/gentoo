                 applicable licenses from the External Software provider,
                 which shall take precedence over the rights and restrictions
                 granted in this EULA solely with respect to such External
                 Software. You shall comply with the terms of all applicable
                 Third Party Software and Open Source Software licenses, if
                 any. Copyrights to Open Source Software are held by their
                 respective copyright holders indicated in the copyright
                 notices in the corresponding source files. The Software may
                 include software developed by the OpenSSL Project for use in

                 REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR
                 STATUTORY, WITH RESPECT TO SUCH EXTERNAL SOFTWARE, INCLUDING
                 WITH RESPECT TO FUNCTIONALITY OF SUCH EXTERNAL SOFTWARE.
                 Ubiquiti does not provide any warranty, maintenance,
                 technical or other support for any External Software.
                 Accordingly, Ubiquiti is not responsible for Your use of any
                 External Software or any personal injury, death, property
                 damage (including, without limitation, to Your home), or
                 other harm or losses arising from or relating to Your use of
                 any External Software.

            trade secrets, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other
            intellectual property and proprietary rights in any jurisdiction
            worldwide (collectively, “Intellectual Property Rights”) in and
            to the Software and the Content are the sole property of Ubiquiti
            or its licensors. You do not have or receive any title or
            interest in or to the Software, the Content, or the Intellectual
            Property Rights contained therein through Your use of the
            Software or otherwise. Except as expressly granted to You under
            the limited license set forth in Section II(a) of this EULA,

            agree to hold such trade secrets and proprietary information in
            confidence and You acknowledge that any actual or threatened
            breach of this obligation will constitute immediate, irreparable
            harm for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy,
            and that injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy for such
            breach.
          * Trademarks. All trademarks, service marks, trade names and logos
            and the goodwill associated therewith (“Marks”) included or

            foregoing, Ubiquiti withholds the right to require You to install
            any patches, bug fixes, corrections, updates, upgrades, support
            and maintenance releases or other modifications in order to
            access and use the Software.

    4. Term and Termination. This EULA will remain in full force and effect
       so long as You continue to access or use the Software, or until
       terminated in accordance with this EULA. You may discontinue Your use
       of and access to the Software at any time. Ubiquiti will automatically
       terminate this EULA at any time without notice to you if you fail to
       comply with any term of this EULA. You may terminate it at any time
       upon written notice to Ubiquiti at legal@ubnt.com. Upon any such

            regulations, including United States export regulations, such as
            restrictions of the Department of Commerce, the United States
            Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC")
            or other foreign agency or authority’s regulations ("Export
            Laws"), and You shall not (ii) export, or allow the export or
            re-export of, the Software in violation of any such restrictions,
            laws or regulations, or available in any country in contravention
            of any Export Laws, or any other law, nor (iii) make the Software
            available in a country for which an export license or other
            governmental approval is required without first obtaining all
            necessary licenses or other approvals. You shall obtain and bear
            all expenses relating to any necessary licenses and exemptions
            with respect to the export from the U.S. of the Software to any
            location.
          * You acknowledge that the U.S. government maintains embargoes and
            sanctions against certain countries, currently including the
            Crimea region of Ukraine, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and
            Syria, which may be amended from time to time, including with
            respect to listed countries; and that other countries may have
            trade laws pertaining to import, use, export or distribution of
            the Software. You acknowledge that, in each case, compliance with
            the same is Your responsibility. You represent and warrant that
            You are not a person or entity listed on any United States
            Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

    9. Miscellaneous.

          * Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This EULA shall not be governed by
            the 1980 U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
            of Goods; rather, this EULA shall be governed by the laws of the
            State of New York, including its Uniform Commercial Code, without
            reference to conflicts of laws principles. Any action or
            proceeding relating to this EULA must be brought in a federal or
            state court located in New York and each party irrevocably
            submits to the jurisdiction and venue of any such court in any
            such claim or dispute, except that Ubiquiti may seek injunctive
            relief in any court having jurisdiction to protect its
            confidential information or intellectual property.
          * Government Purposes. The Software was developed solely at private
            expense and is a “commercial item” consisting of “commercial
            computer software” and “commercial computer software
            documentation” within the meaning of the applicable civilian and
            military Federal acquisition regulations and any supplements
            thereto, as amended from time to time. If the user of the
            Software is an agency, department, employee or other entity of
            the United States Government, consistent with 48 C.F.R.
            227.7202-1 through 227.702-4 (JUNE 1995), the use, duplication,
            reproduction, release, modification, disclosure and transfer of
            the Software, including technical data or manuals, is governed by
            the terms and conditions contained in this EULA.
          * Severability. If any of the provisions, either in part or in
            full, of this EULA is held by a court or other tribunal of
            competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, such
            provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible or
            permissible and this EULA will be interpreted so as to give
            maximum effect to the original intent of the parties with respect
            to the unenforceable provision, and the remaining portions of
            this EULA shall remain in full force and effect.
          * Assignment. You may not assign any of Your rights or obligations
            under this EULA without Ubiquiti’s express written consent.
            Ubiquiti may assign this EULA without Your consent provided that
            such assignment is to an affiliated company forming part of the
            Ubiquiti group of companies.
          * Waiver. The waiver by either party of any default by the other
            party shall not waive subsequent defaults by such other party of
            the same or different kind. The failure of either party to
            enforce the provisions hereof, at any time or for any period of
            time, or the failure of either party to exercise any option
            herein, shall not be construed as a waiver of such provision or
            option and shall in no way affect that party’s right to enforce
            such provisions or exercise such option.
          * Third Party Beneficiary. Licensors and suppliers of Ubiquiti and
            its affiliates are third party beneficiaries of this EULA, and
            thus this EULA is directly enforceable by such licensors and
            suppliers and their affiliates.
          * Statute of Limitations. You agree that regardless of any statute
            or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action You may have
            arising out of or related to use of the Software or this EULA
            must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of
            action arose or be forever barred.
          * Interpretation. As used herein, unless the context requires
            otherwise, the word “or” is not exclusive and the words “will,”
            “will not,” “shall,” and “shall not” are expressions of command
            and not merely expressions of future intent or expectation.
            Whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including” are used
            in this EULA, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
            “without limitation.” The section headings in this EULA are for
            convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
