Once you have configured TT-RSS, put the path to this instance into
the INSTANCE_DIRS variable in /etc/conf.d/ttrssd. Make sure that
the ttrssd user can access the path, and then start the update daemon
with

  /etc/init.d/ttrssd start

to get your feeds updated. Add the daemon to your default runlevel,
so that it gets launched after a system restart:

  rc-update add ttrssd default


With the update to 1.7.0 the 'magpie' RSS parser has been removed.
That means TT-RSS will use the 'simplepie' parser. If you have been
using 'magpie' so far, the switch might cause lots of duplicate
articles - it's a one-time thing for each instance.
