Chora is our tool for viewing code repositories that are managed using 
the CVS source control system. It aims to provide a high degree of 
integration with CVS and the other Horde web-based tools.

Right now, Chora comes close to matching existing CVS-Web scripts 
feature for feature, and provides a solid base for future development. 
Some exciting new features include a visual branch viewing tool, which 
intelligently displays the branch history of a given file. Branches have 
traditionally been a source of confusion when using CVS, and this 
feature aims to make it a bit clearer and easier to use.

Chora is designed from the ground-up with customisability in mind, since 
CVS is used in a variety of different ways. Because of this, all the CVS 
manipulation logic is abstracted away in our CVSLib library module. The 
main PHP scripts are simple HTML rendering scripts, while the complex 
RCS logic is hidden away in the library. This library can be used for a 
variety of other uses, such as searching for commits, graph generation, 
change collation, etc (all features planned for eventual inclusion into 
Chora).
