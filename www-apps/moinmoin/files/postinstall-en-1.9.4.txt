MoinMoin can work with a variety of webservers. Simple Apache instructions
are given below:

1. ExecCGI needs to be enabled in your Moinmoin directory by doing:
# echo "Options ExecCGI" > ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/.htaccess
# echo "AddHandler cgi-script .cgi" >> ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/.htaccess

2. Add the following lines to your Apache configs:
ScriptAlias /mywiki "${MY_INSTALLDIR}/moin.cgi"

3. Restart Apache

4. Go to http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/mywiki/ and follow the instructions there.
