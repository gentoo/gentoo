UPGRADE

                                                            
If you are upgrading from a previous version BACK UP your database.

Once you are done with that, browse to

http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/wp-admin/upgrade.php 

and follow the instructions on the screen.

Note that the default theme has changed between Wordpress 2.x and 3.x,
so if you were using the default theme, your site will fail to load after
the upgrade. Log in to the admin interface and open the themes section to
reset to the new default theme. If you face other troubles after the
upgrade, you might want to look for broken plugins or themes.

!!!!!!!!!                 SECURITY WARNING                   !!!!!!!!!!!
                                                                     
Wordpress has had a history of serious security flaws. Any application
with less widespread use but the same amount of security issues would
have been removed from the tree.
                                                                     
After a short period of being in the unstable tree we once again decided
that we hard mask the package.

THIS MEANS THAT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE WHATSOEVER THAT THE PACKAGE WILL
GET UPGRADED WITHIN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME EVEN IN THE CASE OF
SEVERE SECURITY ISSUES.

We consider installing this package a severe risk to your system and 
you should keep a close eye on the common security trackers so
that you are able to fix problems with your installation yourself if
required.
