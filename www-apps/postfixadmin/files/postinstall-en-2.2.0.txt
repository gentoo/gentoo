You will need to provide a database for your postfixadmin installation.

This assumes you have some knowledge of MySQL, and already have it
installed and configured. If not, please refer to the Gentoo MySQL
guide at the following URL:

http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/mysql-howto.xml

Log in to MySQL, and create a new database as well as a user with full
access to this database. After that you will need to provide the details
of this database and the associated user within the file

${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config.inc.php

Make sure you also set

  $CONF['configured'] = true;

in this file.

Finally you should be able to complete the installation of postfixadmin
by pointing your browser at

  http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/setup.php


Updating from older version of Postfix Admin:
  * When you are upgrading from an older Postfix Admin version, make sure you
  * backup your database before you run the update script on your database.
  *   mysqldump -a -u root -p > /tmp/postfixadmin-backup.sql

  For update from 1.5.x version of Postfix Admin:
    1. Please read the DOCUMENTS/UPGRADE.TXT
	2. Run: http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/setup.php


To use Virtual Vacation, please read VIRTUAL_VACATION_INSTALL.

Check the config.inc.php file. There you can specify settings that are
relevant to your setup.

Postfix Admin contains 3 views of administration:
  1. Site Admin view, located at http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/admin/.
  2. Domain Admin view, located at http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/.
  3. User Admin View, located at http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/users/.

In order to do the initial configuration you have to go to the Site Admin view.
