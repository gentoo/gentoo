First Time Installation
=======================
PostfixAdmin can use either MySQL or PostgreSQL. It is up to you, or your
database administrator, to provide a database and a user with full access to
the database for use by PostfixAdmin.

If you are unfamiliar with MySQL or PostgreSQL, we have some good starting
guides:

  * http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/mysql-howto.xml
  * https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/PostgreSQL

Once the database and user have been allocated, you will need to provide the
details of this database and the associated user within the configuration file:

  ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config.inc.php

In the same configuration file, check for other settings that are relevant to
your setup. Once you're finished with your changes, make sure you set:

  $CONF['configured'] = true;

To use Virtual Vacation, please read VIRTUAL_VACATION_INSTALL.

Finally you should be able to complete the installation of postfixadmin by
pointing your browser at:

  http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/setup.php

Postfix Admin contains 3 views of administration:
  1. Site Admin view, located at http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/admin/.
  2. Domain Admin view, located at http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/.
  3. User Admin View, located at http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/users/.

In order to do the initial configuration you have to go to the Site Admin view.

Upgrading
=========
When updating from older version of PostfixAdmin, make sure you backup your
database before you run the update script on your database.

  * mysqldump -a -u root -p > /tmp/postfixadmin-backup.sql
  * pg_dump -U postgres -d postgres -C -f pa-db-backup.sql postfixadmin_db

For update from version 1.5.x of PostfixAdmin:
  1. Please read the DOCUMENTS/UPGRADE.TXT
  2. Run: http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/setup.php
