There is a few variants of configuration:
1) Via global config file: /etc/cgitrc
2) Or via local config file, shipped in ./conf dir into webapp_dir. It has to
   be explicitly specified with CGIT_CONFIG env variable in your web server
   configuration.

If you would like to update the list of git repositories in cgit automatically,
you might consider adding something similar to the following as a cronjob:

"${MY_CGIBINDIR}/cgit.cgi --scan-tree=/git/repo-parent-path > /etc/cgit-repos"

Then add "include=/etc/cgit-repos" in /etc/cgitrc. This way it's simpler and
more convenient. You won't need to update your cgitrc every time you add a new
repository.

                              Apache HowTo
===============================================================================

With a default apache vhost config you can now access your repository at
http://<vhostname>/cgi-bin/cgit.cgi/

If you wish to access your repository starting from the root and don't want
'cgi-bin/cgit.cgi' to be invisible, 2 things are needed.

In your apache vhost configuration file for your domain, add the following
rewrite rules to your
<Directory /var/www/<vhostname>/htdocs> section.
<snip>
        RewriteEngine On
        # Redirect all non-existant urls to cgit
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        RewriteRule ^.* /cgi-bin/cgit.cgi/$0 [L,PT]

        # Redirect the empty url to cgit
        RewriteRule ^$ /cgi-bin/cgit.cgi/ [L,PT]
<snip>

To make cgit create the correct URL's internally add to /etc/cgitrc (or your
local config file)
Enable virtual-root=/

After these rules, you can now access cgit via http://<vhostname>/ to get the
listing, and http://<vhostname>/repository to go directly to repository.
