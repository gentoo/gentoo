You are almost done!

  0. Make sure your database server is initialized and started,
     and that you have the login details of a user who can create a database.

  1. Login on http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}
     and finish the installation.

     If the installation hangs, you might want to modify your php.ini:

     max_execution_time = 3000 ;
     memory_limit=128M ;

  2. Move into the directory where you installed Joomla and remove
     the "installation" folder:

  # cd ${MY_INSTALLDIR}
  # rm -rf installation

  3. You can now launch your browser and point it to your Joomla site e.g.

  http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR} -> Main Site
  http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/administrator -> Admin

  You can log into the administration view using the username 'admin'
  along with the password that was generated or you chose during the
  web based installation.

  Enjoy Joomla!
