Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides a stable and 
featureful individual calendar system for every Horde user, and 
collaboration/scheduling features are starting to take shape. It makes 
extensive use of the Horde Framework to provide integration with other 
applications.

Right now, Kronolith implements a solid, stand-alone calendar system, 
allowing repeating events, all-day events, custom fields, keywords, and 
managing multiple users through Horde Authentication. The calendar API 
that Kronolith uses is abstracted such that it could work with any 
backend, but right now we provide SQL (abstracted to support most 
databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MSSQL via PEAR DB) 
and MCAL backend libraries.

The latest (not yet released) version, available from CVS supports 
shared calendars, allowing others various levels of access to your 
calendar, better iCalendar support, and generation of iCalendar 
free/busy information.
