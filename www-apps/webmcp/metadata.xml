WebMCP is web application framework written in Lua and C. Instead of using the classical Model-View-Controller (MVC) concept, WebMCP makes use of a so-called Model-View-Action concept. The database is accessed through the Model layer, which provides an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM). HTTP-GET requests are handled by Views, which process the request data, query the database, and render the result. HTTP-POST requests are handled by Actions, which can write to the database and redirect to a View, dependent on success or failure.
