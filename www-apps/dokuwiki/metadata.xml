		DokuWiki is a standards compliant, simple to use Wiki, mainly aimed at
		creating documentation of any kind. It is targeted at developer teams,
		workgroups and small companies. It has a simple but powerful syntax
		which makes sure the datafiles remain readable outside the Wiki and
		eases the creation of structured texts. All data is stored in plain text
		files - no database is required.
