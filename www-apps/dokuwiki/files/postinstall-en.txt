To complete installation you need to perform the following steps:

    1) Configure dokuwiki base options
    2) Check the config
    3) Notes

1 - Configure dokuwiki base options

    The first thing we need to do is set base options of dokuwiki:

    $ cd ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/conf

     Edit dokuwiki/conf/dokuwiki.php (see config [1]) if you want to change
     anything within it. Better yet, create ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/conf/local.php containing
     those lines from dokuwiki.php which you want to change. This way, your
     changes are preserved when overwriting the dokuwiki.php with a new
     release.
    
    $ cp local.php.dist local.php

2 - Check the config

    Finally, test if everything is set up correctly. Use the check option in a
    URL and pull it up into a browser:

    http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/doku.php?do=check

3) - Notes
    
    Please see the website [2] for more information on setting up dokuwiki.

    Dokuwiki's default config leaves editing wide open, so please read the
    acl [3] and user [4] documentation before proceding farther. If you use
    the plaintext authentication, you may need to do the following:

    $ cd conf/
    $ cp users.auth.php.dist users.auth.php
    $ cp acl.auth.php.dist acl.auth.php
    $ chown apache:apache users.auth.php acl.auth.php

    This enables apache to write to the files for editing the acl/user
    creation capability.

    If you're updating from an older version of Dokuwiki or want to learn about
    other authentication methods, check the documentation about authentication
    backends and plugins[5].
