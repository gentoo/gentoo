IMPORTANT! Ensure that the group assigned to group-writeable paths
such as config.php (see above) is one your PHP user is a member
of. This may or may not be your web server group, ${VHOST_SERVER_GID}.
If not, adjust your PHP user and/or reinstall the application with
webapp-config while specifying an appropriate group with -g. Then...

1. Set up a database.
2. Continue the installation by visiting the URL in your browser.
3. Delete the "install" folder as follows:

   # cd ${MY_INSTALLDIR}
   # rm -rf install

4. phpBB is now ready to use. Enjoy!
