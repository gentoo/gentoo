You are almost done!

  0. Setup a database (e.g. MySQL: see 
                       http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/mysql-howto.xml)

  1. Login on

     http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}

     and finish the installation.

  2. Move into the directory where you installed phpBB and remove
     the "install" folder:

     # cd ${MY_INSTALLDIR}
     # rm -rf install

  3. You can now launch your browser and point it to your phpBB site:

     http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR} 

  Enjoy phpBB!
