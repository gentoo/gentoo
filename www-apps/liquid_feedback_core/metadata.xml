LiquidFeedback is an open-source software, powering internet platforms for proposition development and decision making.
LiquidFeedback is an independent open source project published under MIT license by the Public Software Group of Berlin, Germany.
The developers of LiquidFeedback have joined together in the Interaktive Demokratie association to promote the use of electronic media for democratic processes.
The core consists of a database scheme for the PostgreSQL database, including the algorithms for delegations, feedback and the voting procedure implemented as SQL views and database procedures written in PL/pgSQL. As it is licensed under the liberal MIT/X11-License you can include it in any software project you like, as long as there is PostgreSQL support for your programming language available.
