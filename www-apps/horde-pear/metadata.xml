<longdescription>
Horde 2.x, IMP 3.x, and all other Horde applications make use of the 
PEAR libraries to handle such tasks as database abstraction, mail 
delivery and logging. These libraries come bundled with PHP4. However, 
since PEAR is a rapidly evolving target, not everyone who has a workable 
version of PHP4 has a recent enough PEAR installation.
