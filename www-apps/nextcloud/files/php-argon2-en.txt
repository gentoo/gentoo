Migrating from an existing Nextcloud deployment

if you migrate data from a previously existing Nextcloud deployment, you may
need to enable USE=argon2 on dev-lang/php (if previous system ran on a php
version using this hashing algorithm)

This is not listed in ebuild requirements as this will not be required for
most systems (new installs and some migrations)
