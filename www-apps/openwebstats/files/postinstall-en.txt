INSTALLATION

The ebuild installs most parts of openwebstats automatically, but 
you will have to create a database for the apache log records.

You can do this using the following commands as the mysql root user:

> mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE ows;
                       GRANT CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ows.* TO 'ows'@'localhost' 
		       IDENTIFIED BY 'pass';
                       FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"

Please do not forget to choose a password that is more sensible than 
'pass' ;)

Now as user "ows":

> mysql -u ows -ppass ows < ${MY_SQLSCRIPTSDIR}/mysql/${PV}_create.sql

You also need to set the MySQL passwords for the ows user in 
the ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config.php file 
so that openwebstats can access the database. 

If you use a special logfile format for your web server you should 
also modify the log format in the config.php file.

Make sure your access_log is readable if you want to use the update
function of the web frontend.

> chmod 644 /var/log/apache2/access_log 

Now you can go to http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR} and use the
application.
