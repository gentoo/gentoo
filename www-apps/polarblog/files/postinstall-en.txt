Now execute:

cp ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/css/<one_of_css_files>.css.dist ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/css/<one_of_css_files>.css
cp ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config/config.php.dist ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config/config.php
and edit them. As a minimum, set LIB_PATH, DB_PREFIX, DB_HOST, DB_NAME,
DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, CSS.

Then go to http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/install.php to finish the installation.
Don't forget to delete ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/install.php when you are done.
