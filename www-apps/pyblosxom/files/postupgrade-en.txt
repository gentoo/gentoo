pyblosxom-1.3 changes nearly nothing in the config file.

The only new variable you need to set is 'blog_rights'. It should
contain your name and will be added to the atom feed.

Anyway you only need to run etc-update on you config file as 
suggested by webapp-config. Update the configuration following
standard procedures and you should be all set.

Enjoy pyblosxom!
