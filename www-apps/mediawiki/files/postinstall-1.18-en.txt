To complete installation you need to proceed the following steps:
=================================================================

1. Temporarily make the "mw-config" directory writable to the user the web
server is running as. The quickest way is to make the directory world
writable. For example:

$ cd ${MY_INSTALLDIR}
$ chmod a+w mw-config


2. Configure database.
a.) If you know the root password on your database, the MediaWiki installation
script can create a new database for you.

b.) If you don't know the root password, MediaWiki still needs database to
work with. So, please, read the following link and find solution which suits
your needs best:

http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Installing_MediaWiki#Create_a_database


3. Now continue the installation through web browser by accessing the
following page:

http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}${VHOST_APPDIR}/mw-config/
 

4. After the setup script has finished running successfully, a file called
LocalSettings.php is created in the "mw-config" directory. Move this file to the
root wiki directory (${MY_INSTALLDIR}):

$ mv mw-config/LocalSettings.php .

Set stringent permissions on the LocalSettings.php file:

$ chown <webserver-user>:root LocalSettings.php
$ chmod 600 LocalSettings.php

And delete the "mw-config" directory:

$ rm -rf mw-config


5. Once you have done the above, your wiki should be ready to use!

http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}${VHOST_APPDIR}/
 

Enabling Optional Features and other configuration
==================================================

Allow images and other files to be uploaded through the wiki
------------------------------------------------------------

If you wish to enable images and other files to be uploaded through wiki then
edit the LocalSettings.php file and set \$wgEnableUploads to 'true':

\$wgEnableUploads       = true;

Now if MediaWiki was built with the imagemagick USE-flag the directory
permissions are correct, otherwise install ImageMagick and adjust permissions
on the images directory to allow the web server to write. For example:
 
$ chown <webserver-user>:<webserver-group> ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/images

IMPORTANT: Uploads need to be set up properly in order to be secure! For more
details take a look at the following page:

http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgEnableUploads


Math Support
------------

Math support has been removed from the core mediawiki package from 1.18.0
onwards. See http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Math to enable math
support.
