Upgrade Instructions
====================

This is brief and generic information about Trac.

See the releases notes at http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracDev/ReleaseNotes
for the Trac version you have installed to learn about software changes and
possible caveats.

If you are upgrading from a previous Trac version, please follow the
instructions here:

	http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracUpgrade

You will need to run trac-admin commands (upgrade, wiki upgrade...) for each
Trac environment you have.

You might also want to check for new configuration options by comparing trac.ini
file with trac.ini.sample file in the conf/ directory in each Trac environment.
