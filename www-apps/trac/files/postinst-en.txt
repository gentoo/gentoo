See the releases notes at http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracDev/ReleaseNotes
for the Trac version you have installed to learn about software changes and
possible caveats.

Web Server
----------

Trac installation depends on the web server you are using.

CGI users: see http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracCgi

Apache 2 and mod_python users: you have to manually emerge

You can also use Trac without having to install a web server. See
http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracStandalone to know more.

Trac relies on the web server for users authentication. Please refer to the
Trac wiki and to your web server documentation to set up authentication.

Trac environments
