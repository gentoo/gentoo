You are almost done!

  1. Restart your webserver

  2. You will need to create a blank database for phprojekt to use. Consult
  your database manual.

  3. If this is a new install, you will need to
  touch ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config.inc.php
  chown ${VHOST_SERVER_GID}:${VHOST_SERVER_UID} ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config.inc.php

  4. It's a good idea to check your configuration by running
  http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/env_test.php
  Examine its output and fix whatever problems you encounter.

  5. Complete the installation by logging on to
  http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/setup.php

  Enjoy!
