Define your virtual host like this:
<VirtualHost *:80>
	DocumentRoot ${VHOST_HTDOCSDIR}
	ServerName ${VHOST_HOSTNAME}
	
	#Use dspam.cgi as main index
	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteRule ^/?$ /cgi-bin/dspam.cgi [redirect,last]
	
	SuexecUserGroup dspam dspam
	ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ ${VHOST_CGIBINDIR}/

	<Directory "${VHOST_CGIBINDIR}">
		Options FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
		SetHandler cgi-script

		AllowOverride None
		Order deny,allow
		Allow from all

		AuthType basic
		AuthName "DSPAM Control Center"
		#For those lucky enough to have a LDAP authentication database
		AuthLDAPURL ldap://localhost:389/ou=People,dc=yourdomain,dc=com?uid?sub?(objectClass=posixAccount)
		Require valid-user
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>

The configuration files are:
   - ${VHOST_CGIBINDIR}/configure.pl
   - ${VHOST_CGIBINDIR}/admins (super-users of this service)
   - ${VHOST_CGIBINDIR}/default.prefs (not used by those who use MySQL or PostgreSQL backend)
