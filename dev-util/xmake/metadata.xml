  <longdescription lang="en">
    xmake is a lightweight cross-platform build utility based on Lua. It uses
    xmake.lua to maintain project builds. Compared with makefile/CMakeLists.txt,
    the configuration syntax is more concise and intuitive. It is very friendly
    to novices and can quickly get started in a short time. Let users focus more
    on actual project development.
    It can compile the project directly like Make/Ninja, or generate project
    files like CMake/Meson, and it also has a built-in package management system
    to help users solve the integrated use of C/C++ dependent libraries.
