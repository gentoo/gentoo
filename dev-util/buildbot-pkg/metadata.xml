	BuildBot is a system to automate the compile/test cycle required
	by most software projects to validate code changes.
	Features:
		* run builds on a variety of slave platforms
		* arbitrary build process: handles projects using C, Python, whatever
		* minimal host requirements: python and Twisted
		* slaves can be behind a firewall if they can still do checkout
		* status delivery through web page, email, IRC, other protocols
		* track builds in progress, provide estimated completion time
		* flexible configuration by subclassing generic build process classes
		* debug tools to force a new build, submit fake Changes, query slave status
		* released under the GPL
