		Debootstrap is a tool which will install a Debian base system into
		a subdirectory of another, already installed system. It doesn't
		require an installation CD, just access to a Debian repository. It
		can also be installed and run from another operating system, so,
		for instance, you can use debootstrap to install Debian onto an
		unused partition from a running Gentoo system. It can also be used
		to create a rootfs for a machine of a different architecture, which
		is known as "cross-debootstrapping".
