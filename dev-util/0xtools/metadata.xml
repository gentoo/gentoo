    0x.tools is a set of open-source utilities for analyzing application
    performance on Linux. It has a goal of deployment simplicity and minimal
    dependencies, to reduce friction of systematic troubleshooting. There’s no
    need to upgrade the OS, install kernel modules, heavy monitoring
    frameworks, Java agents or databases. These tools also work on
    over-decade-old Linux kernels, like version 2.6.18 from 14 years ago.
    0x.tools allow you to measure individual thread level activity, like thread
    sleep states, currently executing system calls and kernel wait locations.
    Additionally, you can drill down into CPU usage of any thread or the system
    as a whole. You can be systematic in your troubleshooting - no need for
    guessing or clever metric-voodoo tricks with traditional system-level
    statistics.
