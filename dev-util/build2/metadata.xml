		build2 is an open source (MIT), cross-platform build toolchain
		for developing and packaging C and C++ code. It is a hierarchy
		of tools that includes the build system, package dependency
		manager (for package consumption), and project dependency
		manager (for project development). Key features:

		Next-generation, Cargo-like integrated build toolchain for C
		and C++.

		Covers entire project lifecycle: creation, development,
		testing, and delivery.

		Uniform and consistent interface across all platforms and
		compilers.

		Fast, multi-threaded build system with parallel building and
		testing.

		Archive and version control-based package repositories.

		Dependency-free, all you need is a C++ compiler.
