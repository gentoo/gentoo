    The more-than-seven dwarves is a collection of tools that allows
    to inspect and query the DWARF2 information present in ELF files
    built with full debug information. These tools include pahole
    (Poke-a-hole) and codiff, and were originally designed to inspect
    the Linux kernel and its modules, but can be used in for
    user-space software too.
