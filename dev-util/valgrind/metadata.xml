		Valgrind is a GPL'd tool to help you find memory-management problems
		in your programs. When a program is run under Valgrind's supervision,
		all reads and writes of memory are checked, and calls to
		malloc/new/free/delete are intercepted. As a result, Valgrind can
		detect problems such as

		- Use of uninitialised memory
		- Reading/writing memory after it has been free'd
		- Reading/writing off the end of malloc'd blocks
		- Reading/writing inappropriate areas on the stack
		- Memory leaks -- where pointers to malloc'd blocks are lost forever
		- Passing of uninitialised and/or unaddressible memory to system calls
		- Mismatched use of malloc/new/new [] vs free/delete/delete []
		- Some abuses of the POSIX Pthreads API
