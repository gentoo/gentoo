		Statifier is a tool for creating portable, self-containing Linux executables.
		It creates from dynamically linked executables and all it's libraries one file. 
		This file can be copied and run on another machine without need to drag all it's libraries.
		Dynamically linked executables are smaller then statically linked.
		From the other side dynamically linked executables use shared libraries compiled
		in PIC (position independend code) which is slower than "normal" one.
