		Packer is an open source tool for creating identical machine images for
		multiple platforms from a single source configuration. Packer is lightweight,
		runs on every major operating system, and is highly performant, creating
		machine images for multiple platforms in parallel. Packer does not replace
		configuration management like Chef or Puppet. In fact, when building images,
		Packer is able to use tools like Chef or Puppet to install software onto the
		image.

		A machine image is a single static unit that contains a pre-configured
		operating system and installed software which is used to quickly create new
		running machines. Machine image formats change for each platform. Some
		examples include AMIs for EC2, VMDK/VMX files for VMware, OVF exports for
		VirtualBox, etc.
