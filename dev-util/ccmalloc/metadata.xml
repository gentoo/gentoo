    If you want to remove memory leaks from your C or C++ programs or you
    experience strange bugs, probably due to pointer access to freed data,
    then ccmalloc may be the right tool for you. In general it can help you
    to track down memory related problems with C and C++ programs. It does
    not replace more sophistacted tools such as purify or valgrind, since it
    can not detect illegal memory reads, at least not all type of memory reads.
