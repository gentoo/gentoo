	wsta is a CLI tool written in rust for interfacing with WebSockets. wsta has
	the philosophy of being an easy tool to learn and thus gets out of your way
	to let you work your UNIX magic directly on the WebSocket traffic. The way
	wsta does this is to be as pipe-friendly as possible, letting you chain it
	into complex pipelines or bash scripts as you see fit, or just keep it simple
	and use it as is.
