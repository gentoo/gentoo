		Molecule is a build tool that can build, rebuild or extend Sabayon Linux or
		Gentoo Linux OS releases OpenVZ templates and stage4 tarballs.
		It doesn't contain any specific package manager bit and can work with
		your favourite one. The philosophy of Molecule is simple: ease of use and
		modularity.
		Just like Catalyst, Molecule uses its own .spec file format and learning
		how to write one is just about reading examples provided at
		http://git.sabayon.org/molecules.git/.
		You can tweak your ISO image or create one off your chroot (stage4) in no
		time. Molecule uses a plugin-based system to implement support for new
		execution patterns (like ISO to ISO, ISO to Tar, Chroot to ISO, etc).
		Molecule is born inside Sabayon and is used in its release cycle for both
		daily(live) and versioned ISO images.
		Molecule developers are looking for help for writing user docs and HOWTOs.
