	<longdescription>
		GPP is a general-purpose preprocessor with customizable syntax, suitable for
		a wide range of preprocessing tasks. Its independence from any one
		programming language makes it much more versatile than the C preprocessor
		(cpp), while its syntax is lighter and more flexible than that of GNU m4.
		There are built-in macros for use with C/C++, LaTeX, HTML, XHTML, and Prolog
		files.
