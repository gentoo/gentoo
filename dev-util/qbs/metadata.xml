	Qbs is a tool that helps simplify the build process for developing
	projects across multiple platforms. Qbs can be used for any software
	project, regardless of programming language, toolkit, or libraries used.

	Qbs projects are specified in a QML dialect. QML is a concise, easy to
	learn, and intuitive language that is used successfully in the Qt project.
	Its core is declarative, but it can be extended with JavaScript snippets
	for extra flexibility.

	Qbs is an all-in-one tool that generates a build graph from a high-level
	project description (like qmake or CMake) and additionally undertakes the
	task of executing the commands in the low-level build graph (like make).
