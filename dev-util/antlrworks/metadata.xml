		ANTLRWorks is a novel grammar development environment for ANTLR v3
		grammars written by Jean Bovet (with suggested use cases from
		Terence Parr). It combines an excellent grammar-aware editor with an
		interpreter for rapid prototyping and a language-agnostic debugger
		for isolating grammar errors. ANTLRWorks helps eliminate grammar
		nondeterminisms, one of the most difficult problems for beginners
		and experts alike, by highlighting nondeterministic paths in the
		syntax diagram associated with a grammar. ANTLRWorks' goal is to make
		grammars more accessible to the average programmer, improve
		maintainability and readability of grammars by providing excellent
		grammar navigation and refactoring tools, and address the most common
		questions and problems encountered by grammar developers.
