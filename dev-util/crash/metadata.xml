		The Red Hat crash analysis utility is loosely based on the SVR4 UNIX
		crash command, but has been significantly enhanced by completely merging
		it with the GNU gdb debugger. The marriage of the two effectively
		combines the kernel-specific nature of the traditional UNIX crash
		utility with the source code level debugging capabilities of gdb.
