		GEF is a set of commands for x86/64, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC and SPARC to
		assist exploit developers and reverse-engineers when using old school
		GDB. It provides additional features to GDB using the Python API to
		assist during the process of dynamic analysis and exploit development.
		Application developers will also benefit from it, as GEF lifts a great
		part of regular GDB obscurity, avoiding repeating traditional commands,
		or bringing out the relevant information from the debugging runtime.
