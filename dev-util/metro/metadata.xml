		Metro is a build tool that can build Gentoo Linux OS releases and OpenVZ
		templates. It’s designed to interface with a package manager such as
		Portage/emerge so that users can build their own releases of Gentoo or
		other Linux-based operating systems.

		The heart of Metro is its data-oriented recipe language and associated
		parser, which has been designed to keep operating system builds
		organized, consistent, maintainable and reliable.

		From a Gentoo perspective, you can view Metro as a complete re-thinking
		and redesign of Gentoo’s Catalyst build tool – building on its strengths
		and addessing its weaknesses.
