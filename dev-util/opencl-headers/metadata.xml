		The OpenCL API headers in this package are unified headers and are designed to work
		with all released OpenCL versions. This differs from previous OpenCL API headers,
		where version-specific API headers either existed in separate branches, or
		in separate folders in a branch.

		By default, the OpenCL API headers in this repository are for the latest OpenCL
		version supported. To use these API headers to target a different OpenCL version,
		an application may #define the preprocessor value CL_TARGET_OPENCL_VERSION before
		including the OpenCL API headers. The CL_TARGET_OPENCL_VERSION is a three digit
		decimal value representing the OpenCL API version.
