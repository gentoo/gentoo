		Bear is a tool that generates a compilation database for clang tooling.
		The concept behind Bear is: to execute the original build command and intercept the exec calls issued by the build tool.
		To achieve that, Bear uses the LD_PRELOAD or DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES mechanisms provided by the dynamic linker.
		Bear has two components: the library and the binary.
		The library redefines the exec methods to be used by all child processes.
		The executable enables the use of the library for child processes and writes the output file.
