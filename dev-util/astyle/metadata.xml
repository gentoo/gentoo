  From the web page:

  Artistic Style is a reindenter and reformatter of C++, C and Java source
  code.
      
  When indenting source code, we as programmers have a tendency to use both 
  spaces and tab characters to create the wanted indentation. Moreover, some 
  editors by default insert spaces instead of tabs when pressing the tab key, 
  and other editors (Emacs for example) have the ability to "pretty up" lines 
  by automatically setting up the white space before the code on the line, 
  possibly inserting spaces in a code that up to now used only tabs for 
  indentation. 

  Since the NUMBER of space characters showed on screen for each tab character
  in the source code changes between editors (until the user sets up the 
  number to his liking...), one of the standard problems facing programmers 
  when moving from one source code editor to another is that code containing 
  both spaces and tabs that was up to now perfectly indented, suddenly becomes
  a mess to look at when changing to another editor. Even if you as a 
  programmer take care to ONLY use spaces or tabs, looking at other peoples 
  source code can still be problematic.

  To address this problem I have created Artistic Style - a series of filters,
  written in C++, that automatically reindent &amp; reformat C/C++/Java source 
  files. These can be used from a command line, or it can be incorporated as 
  classes in another C++ program.
