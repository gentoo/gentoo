		A tool that can give numerous reports on memory usage on Linux systems.
		Unlike existing tools, smem can report proportional set size (PSS),
		which is a more meaningful representation of the amount of memory
		used by libraries and applications in a virtual memory system.

		Because large portions of physical memory are typically shared among
		multiple applications, the standard measure of memory usage known as
		resident set size (RSS) will significantly overestimate memory usage.
		PSS instead measures each application's "fair share" of each shared
		area to give a realistic measure.
