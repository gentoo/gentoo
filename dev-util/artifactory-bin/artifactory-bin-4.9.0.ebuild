# Using a binary ebuild until a source ebuild is doable.
# This was previously blocked by two major bugs upstream:
# A lack of documented build instructions - https://www.jfrog.com/jira/browse/RTFACT-8960
# A lack of source releases - https://www.jfrog.com/jira/browse/RTFACT-8961
# Upstream now releases source and instructions (yay!), but most of artifactory's
# dependencies are not in portage yet.
