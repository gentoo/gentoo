ITS4 scans source code, looking for function calls that are potentially
dangerous. For some calls, ITS4 tries to perform some code analysis to
determine how risky the call is. In each case, ITS4 provides a problem report,
including a short description of the potential problem and suggestions on how
to fix the code.
