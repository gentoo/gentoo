The Eclipse Project is an open source project of eclipse.org, overseen by
a Project Management Committee (PMC) and project leaders. The work is done
in subprojects working against a CVS repository. The Eclipse Project
Charter describes the organization of the project, roles and
responsibilities of the participants, and top level development process
for the project. The JDT and PDE are plug-in tools for the Eclipse
Platform. Together, these three pieces form the Eclipse SDK download, a
complete development environment for Eclipse-based tools, and for
developing Eclipse itself.
