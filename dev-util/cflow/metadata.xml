  GNU cflow analyzes a collection of C source files and prints a graph,
  charting control flow within the program.

  GNU cflow is able to produce both direct and inverted flowgraphs for C
  sources. Optionally a cross-reference listing can be generated. Two
  output formats are implemented: POSIX and GNU (extended).
