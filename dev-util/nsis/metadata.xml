NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) is a professional open source
system to create Windows installers. It is designed to be as small and
flexible as possible and is therefore very suitable for Internet distribution.

NSIS is script-based and allows you to create the logic to handle even the
most complex installation tasks. Many plug-ins and scripts are already
available: you can create web installers, communicate with Windows and other
software components, install or update shared components and more.
