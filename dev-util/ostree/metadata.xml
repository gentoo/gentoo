		This project is now known as "libostree", though it is
		still appropriate to use the previous name: "OSTree" (or
		"ostree"). The focus is on projects which use libostree's
		shared library, rather than users directly invoking the command
		line tools (except for build systems). However, in most of
		the rest of the documentation, we will use the term "OSTree",
		since it's slightly shorter, and changing all documentation
		at once is impractical. We expect to transition to the new
		name over time.

		As implied above, libostree is both a shared library and suite
		of command line tools that combines a "git-like" model for
		committing and downloading bootable filesystem trees, along
		with a layer for deploying them and managing the bootloader
		configuration.

		The core OSTree model is like git in that it checksums
		individual files and has a content-addressed-object
		store. It's unlike git in that it "checks out" the files
		via hardlinks, and they thus need to be immutable to prevent
		corruption. Therefore, another way to think of OSTree is that
		it's just a more polished version of Linux VServer hardlinks.
