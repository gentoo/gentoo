	This is the old, and by now very much deprecated, Gtk+ HTML engine. It remains
	available in Gentoo because as of late July 2020 <pkg>app-text/xiphos</pkg>
	continues to rely on it for editor functionality (the alternative, WebKit-based
	editor is not compatible with <pkg>net-libs/webkit-gtk</pkg>:4), however
	it will be removed as soon as Xiphos upstream has implemented an alternative
	solution.
