Caribou is a text entry and UI navigation application being developed as an
alternative to the Gnome On-screen Keyboard. The overarching goal for Caribou
is to create a usable solution for people whose primary way of accessing a
computer is a switch device. The initial goal is to make an in-place on-screen
keyboard suitable for people who can use a mouse but not a hardware keyboard.
