	<longdescription>With Kwave you can edit many sorts of wav-files including multi-channel files. You are able to alter and play back each channel on its own. Kwave also includes many plugins (most are still under development) to transform the wave-file in several ways and presents a graphical view with a complete zoom- and scroll capability.</longdescription>
