# Start LILO global section

# Faster, but won't work on all systems:
#compact
# Should work for most systems, and do not have the sector limit:
lba32
# If lba32 do not work, use linear:
#linear

# MBR to install LILO to:
boot = /dev/hda
map = /boot/.map

# If you are having problems booting from a hardware raid-array
# or have a unusual setup, try this:
#disk=/dev/ataraid/disc0/disc bios=0x80  # see this as the first BIOS disk
#disk=/dev/sda bios=0x81                 # see this as the second BIOS disk
#disk=/dev/hda bios=0x82                 # see this as the third BIOS disk

# Here you can select the secondary loader to install.  A few
# examples is:
#
#    boot-text.b
#    boot-menu.b
#    boot-bmp.b
#
install = /boot/boot-menu.b   # Note that for lilo-22.5.5 or later you
                              # do not need boot-{text,menu,bmp}.b in
                              # /boot, as they are linked into the lilo
                              # binary.
