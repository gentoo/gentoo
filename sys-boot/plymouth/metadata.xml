		Plymouth is an application that runs very early in the boot process
		(even before the root filesystem is mounted!) that provides a graphical
		boot animation while the boot process happens in the background.

		It is designed to work on systems with DRM modesetting drivers. Ideally,
		the goal is to get rid of all flicker during startup.  For systems that
		don't have DRM mode settings drivers, plymouth falls back to text mode.
