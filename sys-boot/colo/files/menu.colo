# The format is:
#   select "Message Goes Here" TimeOut label1 [label2 ... [labelN]]

# This will set the {menu-option} variable to the entry corresponding to the

# Explaination of the goto command...

# Marks are indicated by a line starting with a @ symbol.

# We use this jump to set the {image-name} variable to a kernel image.
