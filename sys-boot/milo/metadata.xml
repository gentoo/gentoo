		On Intel based PC systems, the BIOS firmware sets up the system and
		then loads the image to be run from the boot block of a DOS file
		system. This is more or less what MILO does on an Alpha based system,
		however there are several interesting differences between BIOS firmware
		and MILO, not least of which is that MILO includes and uses standard
		Linux device drivers unmodified. MILO is firmware, unlike LILO, which
		relies on the BIOS firmware to get itself loaded.
