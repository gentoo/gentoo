  Command-line operators to analyze netCDF files
  NetCDF Operator is a suite of programs known as operators. The
  operators are stand-alone, command-line programs executable in a POSIX
  shell. Operators take one or more netCDF files as input, perform an
  operation (e.g., averaging or hyperslabbing), and produce a netCDF
  output file. NCO was originally designed to manipulate and analyze
  climate data, though it works on any netCDF format datasets.
