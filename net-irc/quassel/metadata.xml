		<flag name="system-icons">
			Use <pkg>kde-frameworks/breeze-icons</pkg> rather than icons bundled with Quassel.
		</flag>
		<flag name="dbus">
			Support desktop notifications via the StatusNotifier D-Bus service
			(used by most modern desktop environments).
		</flag>
		<flag name="monolithic">
			Build standalone client with integrated core, no external
			quasselcore needed. Only useful if you don't want to use Quassel's
			client/server model. The server and X flags are not needed in this
			case but it is possible to enable them too.
		</flag>
		<flag name="oxygen">
			Support the Oxygen icon set that was the default for KDE4.
		</flag>
		<flag name="server">
			Build the server binary. If this USE flag is disabled, the
			'core' server binary for quassel is not built, and cannot be
			used. You need this enabled on the server, but you might want to
			disable it on the client.
		</flag>
		<flag name="gui">
			Build the Qt5 GUI client for quassel. If this USE flag is
			disabled, the GUI is not built, and cannot be used. You might
			want to disable this on the server, but you need it enabled on
			the client.
		</flag>
