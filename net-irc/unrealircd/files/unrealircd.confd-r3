# Which configuration file to load instead of unrealircd.conf. If you
# want to run multiple instances of unrealircd, you must edit
# files::pidfile to match UNREALIRCD_PIDFILE. You should also ensure
# that files::tunefile is different for each unrealircd instance. See
# https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Configuration#Files_block
#
# To support multiple instances of unrealircd, you may create symlinks
# in /etc/init.d pointing to /etc/init.d/unrealircd. It is recommended
# that the scheme unrealircd.${instance_name} be used. For each
# instance, you may make a copy of this file with the appropriate name
# to override default options specific to that instance.

# The path where unrealircd is configured to create its pidfile.
UNREALIRCD_PIDFILE="/run/unrealircd/${SVCNAME#unreal}.pid"

# extra options to pass to unrealircd ...
# You should not specify the -f option here; use
