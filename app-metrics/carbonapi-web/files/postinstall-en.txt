1. install and setup a Graphite resolving and rendering instance such as
   app-metrics/carbonapi-booking
2. setup a vhost that:
   - uses default index file browser.html
   - proxies these paths down to the Graphite rendering instance:
     * /render/
     * /metrics/
     * /info/
     * /functions/
     * /tags/
3. the combined setup should load the web browser and interact with your
   Graphite install
