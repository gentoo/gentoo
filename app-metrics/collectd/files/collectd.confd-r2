# The default collectd UNIX socket location in /run/collectd is now
# maintained via tmpfiles service. Therefore, the COLLECTD_GROUP setting
# isn't used anymore.
# If you are going to change UNIX socket location or change COLLECTD_USER
# setting above, make sure you overwrite /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/collectd.conf
# via copy in /etc/tmpfiles.d/collectd.conf to match your setup.

# You can use this configuration option to pass additional options to the

# Per default we wait 1000ms after we have started the service to ensure
# that the daemon is really up and running.
#COLLECTD_SSDARGS="--wait 1000"

# If using a tmpfs mount as the data directory to reduce disk IO or SSD wear,
# you can set these options to save and restore RRD files to a tar archive

# save by running "/etc/init.d/collectd sync".
