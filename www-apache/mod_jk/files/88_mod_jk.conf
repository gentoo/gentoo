<IfDefine JK>
LoadModule jk_module    modules/mod_jk.so

###
### Where to find workers.properties
###
# JkWorkersFile specify the location where mod_jk will find
# the workers definitions.
JkWorkersFile	/etc/apache2/jk-workers.properties


###
### Where to put mod_jk logs
###
# specify the location where mod_jk is going to place its log file.
JkLogFile	/var/log/apache2/mod_jk.log


###
### Set the jk log level [debug/error/info]
###
# info log will contains standard mod_jk activity (default).
# error log will contains also error reports.
# debug log will contains all informations on mod_jk activity
JkLogLevel	info


###
### Select the log format
###
# JkLogStampFormat will configure the date/time format found
# on mod_jk logfile. Using the strftime() format string it's
# set by default to "[%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y]"
#JkLogStampFormat "[%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y] "


###
### JkOptions indicate to send SSL KEY SIZE,
###
# The directive JkOptions allow you to set many forwarding
# options which will enable (+) or disable (-) following option.
#
#
# JkOptions ForwardKeySize , you ask mod_jk, when using ajp13, to
# forward also the SSL Key Size as required by Servlet API 2.3.
# This flag shouldn't be set when servlet engine is Tomcat 3.2.x
# (on by default).
#
#
# JkOptions ForwardURICompat , you told mod_jk to send the URI to
# Tomcat normally, which is less spec compliant but mod_rewrite
# compatible, use it for compatibility with Tomcat 3.2.x engines
# (on by default).
#
#
# JkOptions ForwardURICompatUnparsed , the forwarded URI is unparsed,
# it's spec compliant but broke mod_rewrite.
#
#
# JkOptions ForwardURIEscaped , the forwarded URI is escaped and
# Tomcat (since 3.3 rc2) will do the decoding part.
#
#
# JkOptions ForwardDirectories is used in conjunction with Directory-
# Index directive of Apache web server. As such mod_dir should be
# available to Apache, statically or dynamically (DSO)
#
# When DirectoryIndex is configured, Apache will create sub-requests
# for each of the local-url's specified in the directive, to determine
# if there is a local file that matches (this is done by stat-ing the file).
#
# If ForwardDirectories is set to false (default) and Apache doesn't
# find any files that match, Apache will serve the content of the
# directory (if directive Options specifies Indexes for that directory)
# or a 403 Forbidden response (if directive Options doesn't specify
# Indexes for that directory).
#
# If ForwardDirectories is set to true and Apache doesn't find any
# files that match, the request will be forwarded to Tomcat for
# resolution. This is used in cases when Apache cannot see the index
# files on the file system for various reasons: Tomcat is running on
# a different machine, the JSP file has been precompiled etc.
#
# Note that locally visible files will take precedence over the ones
# visible only to Tomcat (i.e. if Apache can see the file, that's
# the one that's going to get served). This is important if there is
# more then one type of file that Tomcat normally serves - for
# instance Velocity pages and JSP pages.
#
JkOptions +ForwardKeySize +ForwardURICompat -ForwardDirectories


###
### JkEnvVar forward environment vars
###
# The directive JkEnvVar allow you to forward an environment vars
# from Apache server to Tomcat engine.
#
#JkEnvVar SSL_CLIENT_V_START


###
### JkRequestLogFormat set the request format
###
# JkRequestLogFormat will configure the format of mod_jk individual
# request logging. Request logging is configured and enabled on a
# per virtual host basis. To enable request logging for a virtual
# host just add a JkRequestLogFormat config. The syntax of the
# format string is similiar to the Apache LogFormat command, here
# is a list of the available request log format options:
#
# Options	Description
# %b		Bytes sent, excluding HTTP headers (CLF format)
# %B		Bytes sent, excluding HTTP headers
# %H		The request protocol
# %m		The request method
# %p		The canonical Port of the server serving the request
# %q		The query string (prepended with a ? if a query string exists, otherwise an empty string)
# %r		First line of request
# %s		Request HTTP status code
# %T		Request duration, elapsed time to handle request in seconds '.' micro seconds
# %U		The URL path requested, not including any query string.
# %v		The canonical ServerName of the server serving the request
# %V		The server name according to the UseCanonicalName setting
# %w		Tomcat worker name
#
JkRequestLogFormat "%w %V %T"


###
### JkMount assign specific URLs to Tomcat
###
# JkMount directive assign specific URLs to Tomcat. In general the
# structure of a JkMount directive is:
#
# send all requests ending in .jsp to worker1
#  JkMount /*.jsp worker1
#
# send all requests ending /servlet to worker1
#  JkMount /*/servlet/ worker1
#
# send all requests jsp requests to files located in /otherworker will go worker2
#  JkMount /otherworker/*.jsp worker2
#
#
# You can use the JkMount directive at the top level or inside
# <VirtualHost> sections of your httpd.conf file.
#


# We specify an autoalias, that makes it possible that apache is still
# reponsible for serving static html files. All requests of files with
# the ending .jsp will be redirected to a default Tomcat installation which
# uses the default profile. Change this to fit your needs.
jkAutoAlias /var/lib/tomcat-5.5/default/webapps/
jkMount /*.jsp ajp13
