# The location to the Phusion Passenger root directory. This configuration
# option is essential to Phusion Passenger. The correct value is given by the
# installer, and should usually not be changed manually.
PassengerRoot /usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/phusion_passenger/locations.ini

# This option allows one to specify how much information Phusion Passenger
# should write to the Apache error log file. A higher log level value means
# that more information will be logged.
#
# Possible values are:
#
#    0: Show only errors and warnings.
#    1: Show the most important debugging information. This might be useful for
#       system administrators who are trying to figure out the cause of a
#       problem.
#    2: Show more debugging information. This is typically only useful for
#       developers.
#    3: Show even more debugging information.
PassengerLogLevel 0

# This option specifies the default global version of Ruby to use.
PassengerDefaultRuby /usr/bin/ruby

# This option allows one to specify the Ruby interpreter to use for
# specific instances.
# PassengerRuby /usr/bin/ruby

# The maximum number of Ruby on Rails application instances that may be
# simultaneously active. A larger number results in higher memory usage, but
# improved ability to handle concurrent HTTP clients.
PassengerMaxPoolSize 20

# The maximum number of seconds that a Ruby on Rails application instance may
# be idle. That is, if an application instance hasn't done anything after the
# given number of seconds, then it will be shutdown in order to conserve
# memory.
PassengerPoolIdleTime 120

# The maximum number of application instances that may be simultaneously active
# for a single application. This helps to make sure that a single application
# will not occupy all available slots in the application pool.
#
# This value must be less than PassengerMaxPoolSize. A value of 0 means that
# there is no limit placed on the number of instances a single application may
# use, i.e. only the global limit of PassengerMaxPoolSize will be enforced.
PassengerMaxInstancesPerApp 0

# When the PassengerUserSwitching option is enabled a Rails application is started
# as the owner of the file config/environment.rb. So if
# /home/webapps/foo/config/environment.rb is owned by joe, then Passenger will
# launch the corresponding Rails application as joe as well.
PassengerUserSwitching On

# Under no circumstances will Rails applications be run as root. If
# environment.rb is owned by root or by an unknown user, then the Rails
# application will run as the user specified by PassengerDefaultUser.
