    Zed is an abstract engine for text edition. It can be used to write text
    editors, edition widgets, readlines, ... Zed uses Camomile to fully
    support the Unicode specification, and implements an UTF-8 encoded string
    type with validation, and a rope datastructure to achieve efficient
    operations on large Unicode buffers. Zed also features a regular expression
    search on ropes. To support efficient text edition capabilities,
    Zed provides macro recording and cursor management facilities.
