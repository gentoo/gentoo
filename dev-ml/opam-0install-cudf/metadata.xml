		Opam's default solver is designed to maintain a set of packages over
		time, minimising disruption when installing new programs and finding a
		compromise solution across all packages.
		In many situations (e.g. CI, local roots or duniverse builds) this is
		not necessary, and we can get a solution much faster by using a
		different algorithm.
		This package provides a generic solver library which uses 0install's
		solver library. The library uses the CUDF library in order to interface
		with opam as it is the format common used to talk to all the supported
		solvers.
