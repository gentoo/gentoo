	React is an OCaml module for functional reactive programming (FRP). It
    provides support to program with time varying values : applicative
    events and signals. React doesn't define any primitive event or
    signal, this lets the client chooses the concrete timeline.

    React is made of a single, independent, module and distributed under
    the new BSD license.

	Given an absolute notion of time Rtime helps you to manage a timeline 
	and provides time stamp events, delayed events and delayed signals.
