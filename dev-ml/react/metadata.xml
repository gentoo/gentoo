    React is an OCaml module for functional reactive programming (FRP). It
    provides support to program with time varying values : applicative events
    and signals. React doesn't define any primitive event or signal, this lets
    the client chooses the concrete timeline. React is made of a single,
    independent, module and distributed under the new BSD license. Given an
    absolute notion of time Rtime helps you to manage a timeline and provides
    time stamp events, delayed events and delayed signals.
