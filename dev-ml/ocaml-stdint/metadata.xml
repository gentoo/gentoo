  <longdescription>
    The stdint library provides signed and unsigned integer types of various
    fixed widths: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64 and 128 bit.
    This interface is similar to Int32 and Int64 from the base library but
    provides more functions and constants like arithmetic and bit-wise
    operations, constants like maximum and minimum values, infix operators
    conversion to and from every other integer type (including int, float and
    nativeint), parsing from and conversion to readable strings (binary, octal,
    decimal, hexademical), conversion to and from buffers in both big endian
    and little endian byte order.
