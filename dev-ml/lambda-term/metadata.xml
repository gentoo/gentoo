  <longdescription>
    Lambda-term is a cross-platform library for manipulating the terminal.
    It provides an abstraction for keys, mouse events, colors, as well as a set
    of widgets to write curses-like applications. The main objective of
    lambda-term is to provide a higher level functional interface to terminal
    manipulation than, for example, ncurses, by providing a native OCaml
    interface instead of bindings to a C library. Lambda-term integrates with
    zed to provide text edition facilities in console applications.
