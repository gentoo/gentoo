<longdescription> SendEmail is a lightweight, completely command line based, 
SMTP email agent. If you have the need to send email from a command prompt 
this tool is perfect. It was designed to be used in bash scripts, Perl 
programs, and web sites, but it is also quite useful in many other contexts. 
SendEmail is written in Perl and is unique in that it requires NO SPECIAL 
MODULES. It has a straight forward interface, making it very easy to use.
