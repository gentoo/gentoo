    Mailbox-count produces a simple count of mailboxes that exist
    per-domain in some SQL database. The default queries are compatible
    with the schema used by PostfixAdmin but it is possible to supply
    your own queries either on the command-line or in a configuration
    file.

    The summary report lists each domain, along with the number of
    mailboxes owned by that domain. The order is determined by the
    summary query, which lists the domains alphabetically by default.
    The default detail report shows the same, but also contains a list
    of each individual mailbox (again in alphabetical order) belonging
    to the domains.
