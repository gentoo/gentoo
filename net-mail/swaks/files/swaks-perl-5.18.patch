 while running with connection type of "pipe", child process died unexpectedly.  This can mean that the program specified with --pipe doesn't exist.

 Connection closed unexpectedly.  If the close is detected in response to the 'QUIT' swaks sends following an unexpected response, the error code for that unexpected response is used instead.  For instance, if a mail server returns a 550 response to a MAIL FROM: and then immediately closes the connection, swaks detects that the connection is closed, but uses the more specific exit code 23 to detail the nature of the failure.  If instead the server return a 250 code and then immediately closes the connection, swaks will use the exit code 6 because there is not a more specific exit code.
