Follow these instructions to finish setting up mailman. This file and the
original ebuild were tweaked by me <lamer@gentoo.org> but were graciously
submitted by Joby Walker (YOU RULE!) 
2003 Jul 09: updated by Jesus Perez and re-tweaked by me <raker@gentoo.org>
for 2.1.x.

Please view the documentation on Mailman at: http://www.list.org/

This documentation assumes you're using the default gentoo path
(/usr/lib/mailman/), if you've changed it with MAILMAN_PREFIX, adjust them
accordingly.

1) If this is your first time installing mailman, after your "emerge mailman",
you need to add -D MAILMAN to /etc/conf.d/apache or /etc/conf.d/apache2 and restart
apache.

2) In your /etc/conf.d/apache (for apache 1.x)
	or /etc/conf.d/apache2 (for apache 2.x) 
	file add the additional option to the
	APACHE_OPTS or APACHE2_OPTS variable:

	-D MAILMAN

3) Make sure mailman is a part of the cron group

4) This must be done as user mailman:

	su - mailman

Add the cron jobs:

	cd cron
	crontab crontab.in
	cd ..

Create the site password:

	bin/mmsitepass

and main list:

	bin/newlist mailman


5) Change back to root:

	exit

(Postfix users: read the notes at the end of this file before you continue)
Add this to /etc/mail/aliases (and see point 9 for notes):
     mailman:              "|/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman post mailman"
     mailman-admin:        "|/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman admin mailman"
     mailman-bounces:      "|/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman bounces mailman"
     mailman-confirm:      "|/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman confirm mailman"
     mailman-join:         "|/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman join mailman"
     mailman-leave:        "|/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman leave mailman"
     mailman-owner:        "|/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman owner mailman"
     mailman-request:      "|/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman request mailman"
     mailman-subscribe:    "|/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman subscribe mailman"
     mailman-unsubscribe:  "|/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman unsubscribe mailman"

For courier, the aliases have to go to /etc/courier/aliases and you have to skip
the quotes.

Run newaliases (only if you use sendmail).

	newaliases
    
6) Start the mailman daemon:

	/etc/init.d/mailman start

and add it to default runlevel (optional but recommended):

	rc-update add mailman default

7) For each list created (either with web interface or with bin/newlist) 
this must be added to /etc/mail/aliases (see smrsh notes below)
replace <list-name> with the name of the list:

	<list-name>: "|/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman post <list-name>"
	<list-name>-admin: "|/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman admin <list-name>"
	<list-name>-bounces: "|/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman bounces <list-name>"
     	<list-name>-confirm: "|/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman confirm <list-name>"
     	<list-name>-join: "|/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman join <list-name>"
	<list-name>-leave: "|/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman leave <list-name>"
	<list-name>-owner: "|/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman owner <list-name>"
	<list-name>-request: "|/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman request <list-name>"
     	<list-name>-subscribe: "|/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman subscribe <list-name>"
	<list-name>-unsubscribe: "|/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman unsubscribe <list-name>"

For courier, the aliases have to go to /etc/courier/aliases and you have to skip
the quotes.

Run newaliases:

	newaliases

smrsh notes
-----------
(if you use sendmail, you are surely using srmsh) you must note that 
sendmail won't run any program outside of EBINDIR. I tried to change 
EBINDIR using,define(`confEBINDIR', `/usr/lib/mailman/mail')dnl in 
sendmail.mc but it didn't work, so mailman must be placed in EBINDIR, 
which in Gentoo is /usr/adm/sm.bin, so you must run as root:

     ln -s /usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman /usr/adm/sm.bin/mailman

And the lines in /etc/mail/aliases which refer to 
/usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman must be changed to mailman:

     <list-name>:              "|mailman post <list-name>"
     <list-name>-admin:        "|mailman admin <list-name>"
     <list-name>-bounces:      "|mailman bounces <list-name>"
     <list-name>-confirm:      "|mailman confirm <list-name>"
     <list-name>-join:         "|mailman join <list-name>"
     <list-name>-leave:        "|mailman leave <list-name>"
     <list-name>-owner:        "|mailman owner <list-name>"
     <list-name>-request:      "|mailman request <list-name>"
     <list-name>-subscribe:    "|mailman subscribe <list-name>"
     <list-name>-unsubscribe:  "|mailman unsubscribe <list-name>"

exim notes
----------
You can write an exim stanza for the router and transport that looks something
like (Derived from, and in part taken from cpanel):

mailman_virtual_router:
	driver = accept
	require_files = /var/lib/mailman/lists/${lc::$local_part}/config.pck
	local_part_suffix_optional
	local_part_suffix = -admin     : \
						-bounces   : -bounces+* : \
						-confirm   : -confirm+* : \
						-join      : -leave     : \
						-owner     : -request   : \
						-subscribe : -unsubscribe
	transport = mailman_virtual_transport

mailman_virtual_transport:
    driver = pipe
    command = /usr/lib/mailman/mail/mailman \
              '${if def:local_part_suffix \
                    {${sg{$local_part_suffix}{-(\\w+)(\\+.*)?}{\$1}}} \
                    {post}}' \
              ${lc:$local_part}
    current_directory = /usr/lib/mailman
    home_directory = /usr/lib/mailman
    user = mailman
    group = mailman

Note the double colon in the require files.  See
http://wiki.exim.org/FAQ/General_Debugging/Q0060 for more information.

This should be modified if you're using the vhosts USE flag, specifically you
need to modify the location of the config.pck file, to be
${lc::$local_part}-${lc::$domain} instead of simply ${lc::$local_part}, and for the
transport you need to change the last part of the command in the same fashion.

Other Helpful things to know...
-------------------------------
run "bin/check_perms -f" from the root mailman directory
(/usr/lib/mailman) to check and fix permission problems.

The INSTALL file is located in /usr/share/doc/mailman-$VERSION/ 

Postfix notes
-------------
If you're using Postfix, don't manually change your /etc/mail/aliases
file, as described above. Instead, follow these instructions:

http://list.org/mailman-install/node13.html

This will set up Mailman and Postfix to automatically generate the new
aliases when you create new lists. It will also make sure that Postfix
uses the correct group ID when it's talking to Mailman, otherwise you
will get security errors from Mailman.
