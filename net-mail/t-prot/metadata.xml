		This program is a filter which shall improve the readability for messages
		(emails and usenet postings) by *hiding* some annoying parts, e.g. mailing
		list footers, signatures, and TOFU, as well as squeezing sequences of blank
		lines or punctuation.

		TOFU is an acronym that stands for "Text oben, Fullquote unten" (german
		language) which means the style of sadly so many people that just leave all
		the quotes in a reply and add some own lines above. This acronym is what
		gave the script its name - TOFU Protection.
