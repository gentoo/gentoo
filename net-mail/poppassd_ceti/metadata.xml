    Provides a daemon for changing passwords over the network. This feature
    is commonly used for TCP loopback password changing from web scripting
    languages such as Perl and PHP, removing the requirement for setuid perl
    scipts or running a web server process as root. This version of poppassd
    has PAM support, and also optional support for cracklib enforcing the use
    of strong passwords. Note that the protocol is plain text and so insecure
    for all but loopback use.
