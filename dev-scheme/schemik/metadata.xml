	Schemik is a high-level lexically-scoped implicitly-parallel dialect of
	Scheme and Common LISP, this means the parallel execution of programs is
	done independently of the programmer and each program written in Schemik
	always produces the same results no matter which parts of the program are
	executed simultaneously.
