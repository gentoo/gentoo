  <longdescription lang="en">
    Owl Lisp is a simple programming language. The main motivation for
    writing it was to get a portable system for writing standalone
    programs in a subjectively pleasant dialect of LISP, which in this
    case means a minimal core language and runtime, purely functional
    operation and support for asynchronous evaluation.
