  <longdescription>
    Fibers is a Guile library that implements a a lightweight concurrency
    facility, inspired by systems like Concurrent ML, Go, and Erlang. A fiber
    is like a "goroutine" from the Go language: a lightweight thread-like
    abstraction. Systems built with Fibers can scale up to millions of
    concurrent fibers, tens of thousands of concurrent socket connections, and
    many parallel cores. The Fibers library also provides Concurrent ML-like
    channels for communication between fibers.
