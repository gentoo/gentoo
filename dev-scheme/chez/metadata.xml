  <longdescription>
    Chez Scheme is both a programming language and an implementation
    of that language, with supporting tools and documentation.

    As a superset of the language described in the Revised6 Report on
    the Algorithmic Language Scheme (R6RS), Chez Scheme supports all
    standard features of Scheme, including first-class procedures,
    proper treatment of tail calls, continuations, user-defined
    records, libraries, exceptions, and hygienic macro expansion.

    Chez Scheme also includes extensive support for interfacing with C
    and other languages, support for multiple threads possibly running
    on multiple cores, non-blocking I/O, and many other features.
