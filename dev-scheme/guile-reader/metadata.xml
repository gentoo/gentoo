    Guile-Reader is a simple framework for building readers for GNU Guile.
    The idea is to make it easy to build procedures that extend Guile's read
    procedure. Readers supporting various syntax variants can easily be
    written, possibly by re-using existing "token readers" of a standard Scheme
    readers. For example, it is used to implement Skribilo's R5RS-derived
    document syntax.
    Guile-Reader's approach is similar to Common Lisp's "read table", but
    hopefully more powerful and flexible (for instance, one may instantiate as
    many readers as needed).
