HOP is a new programming language designed for the Web 2.0. It is a higher-order language for programming interactive web applications such as web agendas, web galleries, music players, etc. HOP can be viewed as a replacement for traditional graphical toolkits. HOP is implemented as a Web broker, i.e., a Web server that may act indifferently as a regular Web server or Web proxy.
