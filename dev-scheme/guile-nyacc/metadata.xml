    NYACC, for Not Yet Another Compiler Compiler, is set of guile modules for
    generating parsers and lexical analyzers. It also provides sample parsers
    and pretty-printers using SXML trees as an intermediate representation.
    It provides a decent C parser and a `FFI Helper' tool to help create Guile
    Scheme bindings for C-based libraries.
    It provides (partially implemented) compilers based on above mentioned
    parsers to allow execution with Guile as extension languages.
