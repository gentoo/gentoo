  <longdescription lang="en">
    Cyclone Scheme is a brand-new compiler that allows real-world
    application development using the R7RS Scheme Language standard.
    We provide modern features and a stable system capable of generating
    fast native binaries.
    Cheney on the MTA is used by Cyclone's runtime to implement full tail
    recursion, continuations, and generational garbage collection.
    In addition, the Cheney on the MTA concept has been extended to allow
    execution of multiple native threads. An on-the-fly garbage collector
    is used to manage the second-generation heap and perform major
    collections without "stopping the world".
