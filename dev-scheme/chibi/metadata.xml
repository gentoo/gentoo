    Chibi-Scheme is a very small library intended for use as an extension
    and scripting language in C programs. In addition to support for
    lightweight VM-based threads, each VM itself runs in an isolated heap
    allowing multiple VMs to run simultaneously in different OS threads.
    Despite the small size, Chibi-Scheme attempts to do The Right Thing.
    The default settings include:
    - a full numeric tower, with rational and complex numbers
    - full and seamless Unicode support
    - low-level and high-level hygienic macros
    - an extensible module system
    Specifically, the default repl language contains all bindings from R7RS
    small, available explicitly as the (scheme small) library. The language
    is built in layers, however - see the manual for instructions on
    compiling with fewer features or requesting a smaller language
    on startup.
