		Using the uSWID tool or Python API allows one to create, convert and merge
		Software Bill of Materials (SBoM) metadata to and from a number of different
		formats including SWID, coSWID, CycloneDX, SPDX and goSWID. It can also import
		SBoM metadata from .ini files, pkgconfig files, PE binaries including EFI ones,
		and various unspecified firmware files as long as they include the coSWID SBoM
		header. Last but not least, it can be used to embed coSWID SBoM metadata
		into PE/EFI binaries.
