		This program forms part of the required functionality of
		the LSB (Linux Standard Base) specification.

		The program queries the installed state of the distribution
		to display certain properties such as the version of the
		LSB against which the distribution claims compliance as
		well. It can also attempt to display the name and release
		of the distribution along with an identifier of who produces
		the distribution.
