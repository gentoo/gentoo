	<longdescription>
		Epoch is an init system (analogous to systemd or upstart)
		for Linux by Subsentient. It is intended as a lightweight
		solution for lightweight distributions
		that don't want a huge mess just to boot up.

		It has one unified configuration file, is very small in size,
		and it has no external dependencies besides glibc or similar,
		and although installing a shell for /bin/sh is strongly recommended.
