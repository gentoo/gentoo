		nca connects a pseudo terminal to the console's virtual terminals
		(/dev/tty0...n) that are normally only accessible to someone with
		local keyboard access. It is particularly useful in conjunction with
		ncad since it then provides remote console access via SSH; with some
		appropriate system start up scripts, ncad can be started immediately
		the root filesystem has been mounted read-only, providing a cheap,
		and only marginally inferior alternative to a serial console.
