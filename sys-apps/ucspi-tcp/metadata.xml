		ucspi-tcp is a replacement for inetd. It consists of tcpserver and
		tcpclient. tcpserver can listen on sockets and start programs in an
		inetd like fashion except that information like the IP address and
		remote port are communicated via environment variables. tcpclient makes
		a TCP connection and runs a program of your choice. It sets up the same
		environment variables as tcpserver.
