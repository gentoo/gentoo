Subject: fts: don't unconditionally use leaf optimization for NFS

NFS st_nlink are not accurate on all implementations,
leading to aborts() if that assumption is made.
See <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1299169>
* lib/fts.c (leaf_optimization_applies): Remove NFS from
the white list, and document the issue.
