		Firejail is a SUID program that reduces the risk of security breaches
		by restricting the running environment of untrusted applications using
		Linux namespaces and seccomp-bpf. It allows a process and all its
		descendants to have their own private view of the globally shared
		kernel resources, such as the network stack, process table, mount
		table.
