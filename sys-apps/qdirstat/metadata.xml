		Qt-based directory statistics: KDirStat without any KDE -- from
		the author of the original KDirStat.

		QDirStat is a graphical application to show where your disk space
		has gone and to help you to clean it up.

		This is a Qt-only port of the old Qt3/KDE3-based KDirStat, now
		based on the latest Qt 5. It does not need any KDE libs or
		infrastructure. It runs on every X11-based desktop on Linux, BSD
		and other Unix-like systems.
