 Once we start doing it, feed entropy to \fIrandom-device\fR until at least
-\fIfill-watermark\fR bits of entropy are available in its entropy pool (default: 2048).
+\fIfill-watermark\fR bits of entropy are available in its entropy pool.
+By default, this value is set to 75% of the entropy pool size or 2048 bits
+if the entropy pool size couldn't be determined.
 Setting this too high will cause \fIrngd\fR to dominate the contents of the
 entropy pool.  Low values will hurt system performance during entropy 
 starves.  Do not set \fIfill-watermark\fR above the size of the
