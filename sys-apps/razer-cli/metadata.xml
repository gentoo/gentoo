    With this command line interface you can configure your Razer peripherals,
    such as keyboard and mouse, set their colors and effects, etc. The most
    simple use case (for which this tool was originally developed) is to use it
    in symbiosis with pywal. Then this tool will set your Razer colors to
    Pywal's colors.
