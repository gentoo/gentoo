<longdescription> 
	The Portable Network Locality (netloc) software package provides network topology discovery tools, and an abstract representation of those networks topologies for a range of network types and configurations. It is provided as a companion to the Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) package. These two software packages work together to provide a comprehensive view of the HPC system topology, spanning from the processor cores in one server to the cores in another â€“ including the complex network(s) in between.
