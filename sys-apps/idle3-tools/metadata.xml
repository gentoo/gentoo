		Idle3-tools provides a linux/unix utility that can disable, get and set the value
		of the infamous idle3 timer found on recent Western Digital Hard Disk Drives. It
		can be used as an alternative to the official wdidle3.exe proprietary utility,
		without the need to reboot in a DOS environement. A power off/on cycle of the
		drive will still be mandatory for new settings to be taken into account.
