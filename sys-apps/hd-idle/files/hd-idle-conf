# defaults file for hd-idle

# hd-idle command line options
# Options are:
#  -a                      Set (partial) device name of disks for subsequent
#                          idle-time parameters (-i). This parameter is optional
#                          in the sense that there's a default entry for all
#                          disks which are not named otherwise by using this
#                          parameter.
#  -i <idle_time>          Idle time in seconds.
#  -l <logfile>            Name of logfile (written only after a disk has spun
#                          up). Please note that this option might cause the
#                          disk which holds the logfile to spin up just because
#                          another disk had some activity. This option should
#                          not be used on systems with more than one disk
#                          except for tuning purposes. On single-disk systems,
#                          this option should not cause any additional spinups.
#
# Options not exactly useful here:
#  -t <disk>               Spin-down the specfified disk immediately and exit.
#  -d                      Debug mode. This will prevent hd-idle from
#                          becoming a daemon and print debugging info to
#                          stdout/stderr
#  -h                      Print usage information.
