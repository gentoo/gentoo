		The lsvpd package contains all of the lsvpd, lscfg and lsmcode commands.
		These commands, along with a scanning program called vpdupdate, constitute
		a hardware inventory system. The lsvpd command provides Vital Product Data
		(VPD) about hardware components to higher-level serviceability tools. The
		lscfg command provides a more human-readable format of the VPD, as well as
		some system-specific information. lsmcode lists microcode and firmware
		levels. lsvio lists virtual devices.
