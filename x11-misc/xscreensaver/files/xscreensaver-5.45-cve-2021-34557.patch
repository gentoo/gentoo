Subject: [PATCH] Fix updating outputs info

When an output is disconnected, update_screen_layout() will try to unset
a property on window assigned to that output. It does that by iterating
si->screens up to 'count', while 'good_count' signifies how many outputs
are currently connected (good_count <= count). si->screens has few more
entries allocated (at start 10), but if there are more disconnected
outputs, the iteration will go beyond si->screens array.
The only out of bound access there is reading window ID to delete
property from, which in most cases will be a bogus number -> crashing
xscreensaver with BadWindow error.

Fix this by allocating array up to full 'count' entries, even if much
fewer outputs are connected at the moment.
