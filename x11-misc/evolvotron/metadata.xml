		Evolvotron is an interactive "generative art" application for Linux to
		evolve images/textures/patterns/animations through an iterative process
		of random mutation and user-selection driven evolution. (This process
		is also often referred to as "evolutionary art" or "genetic art".) If
		you like lava lamps, and still think the Mandelbrot set is cool, this
		could be the software for you.
