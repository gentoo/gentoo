Iconbox is a free desktop tool that allows applications to be started quickly
with one mouse click. When Iconbox is running, the main window is invisible
until you move the cursor into a chosen area on the desktop. When the Iconbox
window appears, an application is started by clicking on the respective icon.
Afterward, the iconbox window disappears.
