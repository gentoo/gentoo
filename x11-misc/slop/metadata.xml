	<longdescription>
		slop (Select Operation) is an application that queries for a selection
		from the user and prints the region to stdout. It grabs the mouse and
		turns it into a crosshair, lets the user click and drag to make a
		selection (or click on a window) while drawing a pretty box around it,
		then finally prints the selection's dimensions to stdout.
