		Zim is a graphical text editor used to maintain a collection of wiki pages.
		Each page can contain links to other pages, simple formatting and images. Pages
		are stored in a folder structure, like in an outliner, and can have
		attachments. Creating a new page is as easy as linking to a nonexistent page.
		All data is stored in plain text files with wiki formatting. Various plugins
		provide additional functionality, like a task list manager, an equation editor,
		a tray icon, and support for version control.
