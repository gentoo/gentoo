		Normally, xteddy just sits around doing nothing. After all, that's what
		teddy bears are for. Look at him, talk to him, place heavy windows on
		top of him, zap him around until he becomes dizzy, do what you like; he
		will always be your true (albeit virtual) friend. Now you can load other
		pixmaps than the nice teddy, too.
