		X Steps Recorder is a clone of PSR for Windows, a program that allows users
		to make a recording of all of the steps they took. (It's like a screen
		recorder except it doesn't record a video.)

		The main differences are that this only runs on Linux, that it records
		your keystrokes too (!), and that it saves the output as standard html
		(base64-uri-encoded images) rather than mhtml. This allows for easy
		editing of the resultant file, such as to remove passwords you typed
		(which is why psr doesn't record keystrokes in the first place).
