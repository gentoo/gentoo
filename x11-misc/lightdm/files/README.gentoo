 * Even though the default /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf will work for
 * most users, make sure you configure it to suit your needs
 * before using lightdm for the first time.
 * You can test the configuration file using the following
 * command: lightdm --test-mode -c /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf. This
 * requires xorg-server to be built with the 'kdrive' useflag.
 *
 * You can also set your own default values for LIGHTDM_GREETER,
 * LIGHTDM_SESSION, and LIGHTDM_USER in /etc/portage/make.conf
