<longdescription>
gtkdialog is a GUI-creation utility that can be used with an arbitrary
interpreter. It enables the programmer to describe a graphical user interface
in a simple XML-like language, and use it with any interpreter that supports
either files, standard I/O, or environment variables. It can be called as an
external program from the interpreter, but can be used as a stand-alone
framework for the application as well. Stand-alone, bash, and awk examples are
provided.
