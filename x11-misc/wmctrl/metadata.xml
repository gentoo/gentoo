		 The wmctrl program is a command line tool to interact with an 
		 EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window Manager. It provides command line 
		 access to almost all the features defined in the EWMH specification.
		 Using it, it's possible to, for example, obtain information about the
		 window manager, get a detailed list of desktops and managed windows, 
		 switch and resize desktops, change number of desktops, make windows 
		 full-screen, always-above or sticky, and activate, close, move, 
		 resize, maximize and minimize them.
