# ipfw provides a stateful firewall.
# This means we allow everything out, and if we have a connection we allow it
# back in. This is very flexable and quite secure.

# For ease of use, we allow auth and ssh ports through as well.
# To override the list of allowed ports
#PORTS_IN="auth ssh"

# You may want to enable logging of denied connections
#LOG_DENY="yes"
