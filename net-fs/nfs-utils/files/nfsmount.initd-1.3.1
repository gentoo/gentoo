# This is mostly as a fix for bug #537996, to avoid breaking existing users
# with nfsmount in their runlevels.
# If neither nfsclient nor netmount are in your runlevels, and you manually
# start netmount before nfsclient, then this will break. A real solution is
# forthcoming, but requires feature development, see bug #406021 for soft
# dependencies
