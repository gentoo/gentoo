giblib is a utility library used by many of the applications I write. It 
incorporates doubly linked lists, some string functions, and a wrapper 
for imlib2. The wrapper does two things. It gives you access to 
fontstyles, which can be loaded from files, saved to files or defined 
dynamically through the API. It also, and more importantly, wraps 
imlib2's context API changing.
