	giblib is a utility library used by many of the applications I write. It
	incorporates doubly linked lists, some string functions, and a wrapper
	for imlib2. The wrapper does two things. It gives you access to
	fontstyles, which can be loaded from files, saved to files or defined
	dynamically through the API. It also, and more importantly, wraps
	imlib2's context API changing.
