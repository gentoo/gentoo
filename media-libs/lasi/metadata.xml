  libLASi is a library written by Larry Siden that provides a C++
  stream output interface for creating Postscript documents that can
  contain characters from any of the scripts and symbol blocks
  supported in Unicode and by Owen Taylor's Pango layout engine.
  The library accomodates right-to-left scripts such as Arabic
  and Hebrew as easily as left-to-right scripts. Indic and Indic-derived
  Complex Text Layout (CTL) scripts, such as Devanagari, Thai, Lao, and
  Tibetan are supported to the extent provided by Pango and by the
  OpenType fonts installed on your system. All of this is provided
  without need for any special configuration or layout calculation on
  the programmer's part.
  libLASi was designed for projects which require the ability to
  produce Postscript independent of any one application framework.
