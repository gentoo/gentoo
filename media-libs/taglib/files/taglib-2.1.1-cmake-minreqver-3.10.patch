Subject: [PATCH] Raise CMake minimum version to 3.10..3.31 range

CMake 3.10 was released in 2017.

Amends 967aaf7af2f4aa2e9fed0edb2cbaca98b737eebe, fixes warning since CMake-3.31:

CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
  to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.
