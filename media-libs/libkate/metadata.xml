	<longdescription lang="en">Kate is a codec for karaoke and text encapsulation for Ogg. Most of the
		time, this would be multiplexed with audio/video to carry subtitles,
		song lyrics (with or without karaoke data), etc, but doesn't have to be.
		A possible use of a lone Kate stream would be an e-book. Moreover, the
		motion feature gives Kate a powerful means to describe arbitrary curves,
		so hand drawing of shapes can be achieved. This was originally meant for
		karaoke use, but can be used for any purpose. Motions can be attached to
		various semantics, like position, color, etc, so scrolling or fading
		text can be defined.
