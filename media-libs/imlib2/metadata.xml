Imlib 2 is the successor to Imlib. It is not just a newer version - it is a
completely new library. Imlib2 can be installed alongside Imlib 1.x without any
problems since they are effectively different libraries - but they Have very
similar functionality.

Imlib2 can do the following:
* Load image files from disk in one of many formats
* Save images to disk in one of many formats
* Render image data onto other images
* Render images to an X-Windows drawable
* Produce pixmaps and pixmap masks of Images
* Apply filters to images
* Rotate images
* Accept RGBA Data for images
* Scale images
* Alpha blend Images on other images or drawables
* Apply color correction and modification tables and factors to images
* Render images onto images with color correction and modification tables
* Render truetype anti-aliased text
* Render truetype anti-aliased text at any angle
* Render anti-aliased lines
* Render rectangles
* Render linear multi-colored gradients
* Cache data intelligently for maximum performance
* Allocate colors automatically
* Allow full control over caching and color allocation
* Provide highly optimized MMX assembly for core routines
* Provide plug-in filter interface
* Provide on-the-fly runtime plug-in image loading and saving interface
* Fastest image compositing, rendering and manipulation library for X

If what you want isn't in the list above somewhere then likely Imlib 2 does not
do it. If it does it it likely does it faster than any other library you can find
(this includes gdk-pixbuf, gdkrgb, etc.) primarily because of highly optimized
code and a smart subsystem that does the dirty work for you and picks up the
pieces for you so you can be lazy and let all the optimizations for you.

Imlib 2 can run without a display, so it can be easily used for background image
processing for web sites or servers - it only requires the X libraries to be
installed - that is all - it does not require an XServer to run unless you wish
to display images.
