SDL graphics drawing primitives and other support functions
The SDL_gfx library evolved out of the SDL_gfxPrimitives code which provided basic drawing 
routines such as lines, circles or polygons and SDL_rotozoom which implemented a 
interpolating rotozoomer for SDL surfaces.

The current components of the SDL_gfx library are:

    * Graphic Primitives (SDL_gfxPrimitves.h)
    * Rotozoomer (SDL_rotozoom.h)
    * Framerate control (SDL_framerate.h)
    * MMX image filters (SDL_imageFilter.h) 

The library is backwards compatible to the above mentioned code. Its is written in plain C 
and can be used in C++ code.
