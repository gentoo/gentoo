Subject: [PATCH] build: Disable -march selection from CMakeLists.txt

x32 arch as defined on https://sites.google.com/site/x32abi is neither
X86 nor X64, then forcing -march=i686 leads to build failure as wrong
-march is used.

Forcing -march, -mfloat-abi and -mfpu for ARM is also wrong

As a global sanity sake, disable all forced -march in CMakeLists
