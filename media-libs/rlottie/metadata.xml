    rlottie is a platform independent standalone c++ library for rendering 
    vector based animations and art in realtime.

    Lottie loads and renders animations and vectors exported in the bodymovin 
    JSON format. Bodymovin JSON can be created and exported from After Effects 
    with bodymovin, Sketch with Lottie Sketch Export, and from Haiku.

    For the first time, designers can create and ship beautiful animations 
    without an engineer painstakingly recreating it by hand. Since the 
    animation is backed by JSON they are extremely small in size but can be 
    large in complexity!
