Libinsane is the library to access scanners on both Linux and Windows. It's cross-platform, cross-programming languages, cross-scanners :-). It takes care of all the quirks of all the platforms and scanners

It has however some limitations:

* It is only designed to work with scanners, not webcams, not USB keys, etc (think paper-eaters only)
* TWAIN API may display some dialogs. Libinsane cannot prevent them.
* Full bed page scan only: Presence of the option to set the scan area cannot be guaranteed. You may have to crop the image later in your own application (see Paperwork for example).
* 24 bits color scans only (may be fixed later)

It is the successor of Pyinsane2 but shares no code with it.
