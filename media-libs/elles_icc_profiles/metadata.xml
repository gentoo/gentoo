		Elle Stone has developed LCMS-based ICC profile-making code which
		makes a variety of RGB working space profiles, plus Gray profiles,
		plus XYZ and LAB identity profiles. The code includes the most
		commonly used RGB working space profiles (including ACES, ACEScg,
		AdobeRGB1998, ProPhotoRGB, Rec.2020, and sRGB/Rec.709), plus
		an assortment of less commonly used profiles. Each RGB working
		space profile "family" is provided with the profile's standard Tone
		Reproduction Curve ("TRC"), the linear gamma, gamma 1.8, and gamma
		2.2 TRCs, and the sRGB, LAB "L", and Rec709 TRCs, in both V2 and V4
		versions.
		The profiles are carefully checked for accuracy and are guaranteed
		to be well-behaved, making them suitable for colour-managed image
		editing.
