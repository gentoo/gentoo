  libAfterImage is a generic image manipulation library.
  It was initially implemented to address AfterStep Window Manager's needs for
  image handling, but it evolved into software suitable for project
  that has needs for handling images. Most of the popular image formats are
  supported using standard libraries, with XCF, XPM, PPM/PNM, BMP, ICO,
  TGA and GIF being supported internally. PNG, JPEG and TIFF formats are
  supported via standard libraries. Text rendering capabilities
  included, providing support for TrueType fonts using FreeType library,
  and anti-aliasing of standard fonts from X window system.
