    The Mozilla Thunderbird mail client is a redesign of the Mozilla Mail
    component. The goal is to produce a cross-platform stand-alone mail
    application using XUL (XML User Interface Language).

    <p>
    The following vulnerabilities have been reported:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Benjamin Smedberg discovered that chrome URLss could be made to
    reference remote files.</li>
    <li>Developers in the Mozilla community
    looked for and fixed several crash bugs to improve the stability of
    Mozilla clients.</li>
    <li>"shutdown" reports that cross-site scripting
    (XSS) attacks could be performed using the construct
    XPCNativeWrapper(window).Function(...), which created a function that
    appeared to belong to the window in question even after it had been
    navigated to the target site.</li>
    <li>"shutdown" reports that scripts
    granting the UniversalBrowserRead privilege can leverage that into the
    equivalent of the far more powerful UniversalXPConnect since they are
    allowed to "read" into a privileged context.</li>
    <li>"moz_bug_r_a4"
    discovered that Named JavaScript functions have a parent object created
    using the standard Object() constructor (ECMA-specified behavior) and
    that this constructor can be redefined by script (also ECMA-specified
    behavior).</li>
    <li>Igor Bukanov and shutdown found additional places
    where an untimely garbage collection could delete a temporary object
    that was in active use.</li>
    <li>Georgi Guninski found potential
    integer overflow issues with long strings in the toSource() methods of
    the Object, Array and String objects as well as string function
    arguments.</li>
    <li>H. D. Moore reported a testcase that was able to
    trigger a race condition where JavaScript garbage collection deleted a
    temporary variable still being used in the creation of a new Function
    object.</li>
    <li>A malicious page can hijack native DOM methods on a
    document object in another domain, which will run the attacker's script
    when called by the victim page.</li>
    <li>Secunia Research has
    discovered a vulnerability which is caused due to an memory corruption
    error within the handling of simultaneously happening XPCOM events.
    This leads to use of a deleted timer object.</li>
    </ul>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A user can be enticed to open specially crafted URLs, visit webpages
    containing malicious JavaScript or execute a specially crafted script.
    These events could lead to the execution of arbitrary code, or the
    installation of malware on the user's computer.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Mozilla Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-1.5.0.5"</code>
    <p>
    All Mozilla Thunderbird binary users should upgrade to the latest
    version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-1.5.0.5"</code>
  </resolution>
