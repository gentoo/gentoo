  Dia is a gtk+ based diagram creation program. It can be used to
  draw many different kinds of diagrams. It currently has special
  objects to help draw entity relationship diagrams, UML diagrams,
  flowcharts, network diagrams, and simple circuits. It is also
  possible to add support for new shapes by writing simple XML
  files, using a subset of SVG to draw the shape.
