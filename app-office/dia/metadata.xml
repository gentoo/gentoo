    Dia is a gtk+ based diagram creation program. It can be used to
    draw many different kinds of diagrams. It currently has special
    objects to help draw entity relationship diagrams, UML diagrams,
    flowcharts, network diagrams, and simple circuits. It is also
    possible to add support for new shapes by writing simple XML
    files, using a subset of SVG to draw the shape.
