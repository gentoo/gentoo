  <longdescription>
    Manage multiple accounts at a time, with a familiar tab interface. Easily
    filter transactions by type, group, or date. Easily repeat transactions,
    such as bills that occur every month. Transfer money from one account to
    another. Export an account as a CSV file and import a CSV, OFX or QIF file
    to bulk add transactions to an account.
