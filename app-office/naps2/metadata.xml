    NAPS2 on Linux allows you to scan from USB (using SANE) and network
    scanners. Use your chosen settings, or set up multiple profiles for
    different devices and configurations. Once you've finished scanning, you
    can save, email, or print with only a couple clicks. Save to PDF, TIFF,
    JPEG, PNG, or other file types.  Easily rotate, crop, and rearrange
    scanned pages. Adjust brightness, contrast, and apply automatic document
    corrections to make your scanned pages look great. Use OCR to add
    searchable text to your PDFs in any of over 100 languages. Use batch
    scanning, advanced profile settings, and an optional CLI to automate
    tedious tasks.
