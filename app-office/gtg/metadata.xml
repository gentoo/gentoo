		Getting Things Gnome! (gtg) is a personal organizer for the GNOME desktop that
		was inspired by the Getting Things Done methodology (GTD). It is not a GTD only
		software as it aims for flexibility, adaptability and ease of use.

		GTG wants to help you to track everything you need to do and need to know, from
		very small tasks to big projects.

		GTG uses a very handy text edition system for task creation and edition.
		The task editor can automatically recognize metadata such as tags and subtasks
		only by the use of a very simple syntax.
