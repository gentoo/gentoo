How many of you remeber the BBS days back in the late 80's and early 90's? 
Back when you would call in play games and go on with your life? Well I'm 
trying to duplicate one of those old games. It was called Trade Wars 
2002(Created by Martech Software). So I decided to make a game similar to it 
that runs in Linux.
