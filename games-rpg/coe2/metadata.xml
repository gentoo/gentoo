Originally released in 1997, Conquest of Elysium II is a turn-based fantasy
strategy game, and the precursor to the wildly popular Dominions series. As one
of up to eight players (human, computer controlled, or a mixture) your goal, as
suggested in the title, is very simple: total subjugation of all that do not fly
your banner!

Choose your leader from twenty distinct character classes, including brutal
barbarians, insane necromancers, mighty maharajas, sinister shamans, and even
the Agarthan king from Dominions 3! Each character allows new strategies for the
player to explore. The Priestess of Baal can summon demonic creatures, change
the weather, and sacrifice the innocent. An Enchanter can create constructs out
of corpses, lakes, forests, and more. Barons can build siege towers, raise
levies, and keep his subjects in line, even in times of high taxation.
