		Madeleine Valois is a prince's companion. Her job is to guide
		and advise him, to make him look good so that he can land a
		royal bride. It is her responsibility to keep him out of
		trouble - not to let him walk blindly into a political
		minefield, not to let him get arrested for a crime he didn't
		commit, and definitely not to let him fall in love with her.

		Unfortunately, events are not going according to plan...
