  GNU DDD is a graphical front-end for command-line debuggers such as
  GDB, DBX, WDB, Ladebug, JDB, XDB, the Perl debugger, the bash debugger,
  or the Python debugger. Besides ``usual'' front-end features such as
  viewing source texts, DDD has become famous through its interactive
  graphical data display, where data structures are displayed as graphs.
