    A Development Container (or Dev Container for short) allows you to use a
    container as a full-featured development environment. It can be used to run
    an application, to separate tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for
    working with a codebase, and to aid in continuous integration and testing.
    Dev containers can be run locally or remotely, in a private or public
    cloud, in a variety of supporting tools and editors.
