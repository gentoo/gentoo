    Earthly is a versatile, approachable CI/CD framework that runs every
    pipeline inside containers, giving you repeatable builds that you write
    once and run anywhere. It has a super simple, instantly recognizable syntax
    that is easy to write and understand – like Dockerfile and Makefile had a
    baby. And it leverages and augments popular build tools instead of
    replacing them, so you don’t have to rewrite all your builds no matter what
    languages you use.
