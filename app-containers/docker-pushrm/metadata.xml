  <longdescription lang="en">
    docker-pushrm is a Docker CLI plugin that adds a new docker pushrm
    command to Docker.  It pushes the README file from the current working
    directory to a container registry server where it appears as repo
    description in the web interface.  It currently supports Docker Hub, Red
    Hat Quay and Harbor v2.  For most registry types docker-pushrm uses
    authentication info from the Docker credentials store - so it "just
    works" for registry servers that you're already logged into with Docker.
