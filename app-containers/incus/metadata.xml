    Incus is a modern, secure and powerful system container and virtual machine manager.
    Incus is a community fork from Canonical's LXD.

    It provides a unified experience for running and managing full Linux systems inside containers
    or virtual machines. Incus supplies images for a wide number of Linux distributions and is built
    around a very powerful, yet pretty simple, REST API. Incus scales from one instance on a single
    machine to a cluster in a full data center rack, making it suitable for running workloads both
    for development and in production.

    Incus allows you to easily set up a system that feels like a small private cloud. You can run any
    type of workload in an efficient way while keeping your resources optimized.

    You should consider using Incus if you want to containerize different environments or run virtual
    machines, or in general run and manage your infrastructure in a cost-effective way.
