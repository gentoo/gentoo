<longdescription>
  This is a script based approach to version control for TeX documents.
  It works more reliably than keyword substitution based approaches,
  since it tracks all files in a working copy, not only .tex files.

  The vc bundle works with LaTeX and plain TeX. Currently, Bazaar, Git,
  Mercurial and Subversion are supported.
