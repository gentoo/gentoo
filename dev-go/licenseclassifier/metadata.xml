    The license classifier is a library and set of tools that can analyze text
    to determine what type of license it contains. It searches for license texts
    in a file and compares them to an archive of known licenses.
    These files could be, e.g., LICENSE files with a single or multiple licenses in it,
    or source code files with the license text in a comment.
