# Sometimes, it is not necessary to replace the entire style sheet using the
# --static-file option. But instead a small incremental change should be made to
# the visual  appearance  of the terminal. The --css option provides a means to
# append additional style rules to the end of the default styles.css sheet. More
# than one --css option can be given on the same command line.
#
# You shouldn't need to change this value 
# unless you want to load your own style sheets.

# If built with SSL/TLS support enabled, the daemon will look in SIAB_CERT_DIR for any
# certificates. If unspecified, this defaults to the current working directory.         
# 
# If the browser negotiated a Server Name Identification the daemon will look for
# a matching certificate-SERVERNAME.pem file. This allows for virtual hosting
# of multiple server names on the same IP address and port.                                                                                                            
# 
# If no SNI handshake took place, it falls back on using the certificate in the
# certificate.pem file.                                                                  
# 
# The administrator should make sure that there are matching certificates for
# each of the virtual hosts on this server, and that there is a generic certifi‚Äê
# cate.pem file.

# If no suitable certificate is installed, shellinaboxd will attempt to invoke
# /usr/bin/openssl and create a new self-signed certificate. This only
# succeeds if, after dropping privileges, shellinaboxd has write
# permissions for SIAB_CERT_DIR.                                                                                       
# 
# Most browsers show a warning message when encountering a self-signed
# certificate and then allow the user the option of accepting the certificate.
# Due to this usability problem, and due to the perceived security
# implications, the use of auto-generated self-signed certificates is intended
# for testing or in  intranet deployments, only.

# This option is also useful during testing or for deployment in trusted
# intranets, if SSL certificates are unavailable.
