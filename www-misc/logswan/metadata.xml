  <longdescription>
    Logswan is a fast Web log analyzer using probabilistic data structures. It
    is targeted at very large log files, typically APIs logs. It has constant
    memory usage regardless of the log file size, and takes approximatively 4MB
    of RAM. Unique visitors counting is performed using two HyperLogLog
    counters (one for IPv4, and another one for IPv6), providing a relative
    accuracy of 0.10%. String representations of IP addresses are used and
    preferred as they offer better precision. Project design goals include:
    speed, memory-usage efficiency, and keeping the code as simple as possible.
