    There is a remotely exploitable bug in XChat 2.0.6 that could lead to a
    denial of service attack.  Gentoo wishes to thank lloydbates for discovering
    this bug, as well as jcdutton and rac for submitting patches to fix the bug.

  <impact type="medium">
    <p>
    A malformed DCC packet sent by a remote attacker can cause XChat to crash.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    For Gentoo users, xchat-2.0.6 was marked ~arch (unstable) for most
    architectures.  Since it was never marked as stable in the portage tree,
    only xchat users who have explictly added the unstable keyword to
    ACCEPT_KEYWORDS are affected.  Users may updated affected machines to the
    patched version of xchat using the following commands:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    # emerge -pv '&gt;=net-irc/xchat-2.0.6-r1'
    # emerge '&gt;=net-irc/xchat-2.0.6-r1'
    # emerge clean</code>
    <p>
    This assumes that users are running with ACCEPT_KEYWORDS enabled for their
    architecture.
