<longdescription>
  Mg (mg) is intended to be a small, fast, and portable editor for
  people who can't (or don't want to) run real Emacs for one reason
  or another. It is compatible with GNU Emacs because there shouldn't
  be any reason to learn more than one Emacs flavor.

  This is a portable version of the Mg maintained by the OpenBSD team.
