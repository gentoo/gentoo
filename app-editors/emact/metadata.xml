  This product is an original development made to provide an emacs-like editor
  on the PC for the purpose of writing Lisp code with the same features found
  on other Lisp development systems. In 1985, with about 512 Ko of memory, it
  was obvious that Gosling, GNU or other emacs written in Lisp were too big to
  run on M$-DOG. So I decided to write my own editor that closely works like
  those I used on VAX Unix at that time. I started with Conroy's MicroEMACS.

  After a great amount of time, made essentially after hours, EmACT is now
  a pretty good clone of GNU Emacs. It has all the features that programmers
  enjoy, like parentheses matching, auto-indent for Lisp, C, C++, compile
  mode, tags and even a Lisp interpreter which is not however compatible with
  GNU MockLisp. It can be ported to all UN*X systems (terminal and X-Window)
  and it runs of course on all Intel based system in text or graphic mode
  (MSDOS, OS/2, Windows 3.x, Windows NT/2000/XP and Windows 95/98/Me).
