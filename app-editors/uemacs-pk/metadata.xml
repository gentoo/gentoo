  WHAT IS uEmacs/PK?

  uEmacs/PK 4.0 is an enhanced version of MicroEMACS 3.9e. Enhancements have
  been incorporated by Petri H. Kutvonen, University of Helsinki, Finland,
  kutvonen@cs.Helsinki.FI.

  WHY IS IT BASED ON AN OLD VERSION OF MicroEMACS?

  In my opinion 3.9e was the best of all MicroEMACSes. Creeping featurism,
  growing size, and reduced portability made versions 3.10 and 3.11 less
  attractive. MicroEMACS 3.9e was one of the few editors that were truly
  portable between different flavours of UNIX, PC/MS-DOS, and VAX/VMS. It was
  pretty robust - although not flawless. uEmacs/PK 4.0 includes numerous bug
  fixes, adds some new functionality and comfort but does not sacrifice the
  best things (small size and portability).
