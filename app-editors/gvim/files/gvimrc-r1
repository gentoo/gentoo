" This file is read AFTER normal Vim initializations, like reading your .vimrc
" file (and the default /usr/share/vim/vimrc).  So there's no reason to
" duplicate settings from vimrc.  Red Hat has had this wrong for years, to the
" great annoyance of users.

" Pre-GUI settings
set columns=80 lines=30       " don't inherit geometry from parent term
set mousemodel=popup          " right mouse button pops up a menu in the GUI

" Use a sufficiently wide window automatically when started as "gvimdiff"
if (&foldmethod == 'diff')
	set columns=165

" For bug 33327, add a mapping which allows shift-insert to function
" as expected in insert and command-line modes
map! <s-insert> <c-r>*
