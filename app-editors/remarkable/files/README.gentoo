Known Gentoo-related issues:
============================

- export to HTML/PDF does not work (this feature would need the python module
  "wkhtmltopdf" which is not packaged for gentoo and most probably will
  never be - it depends on deprecated Qt WebKit)
- spellchecking is disabled (would need python module pygtkspellcheck which)
  is also not packaged for gentoo yet)
