Subject: [PATCH] files: initialize a variable before referencing it

The lack of initialization caused a nasty bug on some targets (such as
ARMv7) which would make it so that ^S would just say "Cancelled".

While x86 (both 64 and 32 bits) seems to initialize 'response' to zero or
a positive number, ARM does not, and there is usually a negative value in
its place, which triggers the 'if (response < 0)' check and, as a result,
the code says "Cancelled".

This fixes https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?56023.

Bug existed since version 4.0, commit 0f9d60a3.
