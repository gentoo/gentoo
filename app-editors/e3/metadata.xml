  e3 is a full-screen, user-friendly text editor with an interface similar to
  that of either WordStar, Emacs, Pico, Nedit, or vi. It's heavily optimized
  for size and independent of libc or any other libraries, making it useful
  for mini-Linux distributions and rescue disks. The assembler version
  supports Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Win9x, QNX, Atheos, BeOS, ELKS,
  and DOS. There is also a separately distributed version written in C which
  supports some other Unix versions and CygWin. It is also possible to use
  regular expressions by using child processes like sed. e3 has a built in
  arithmetic calculator.
