<longdescription>
   * An Emacs editor biased towards UNIX users, working across platforms by
     providing a consistent interface under UNIX, Microsoft Windows '95/'98/NT
     and DOS operating systems.
   * Fully featured editor, retaining the lightness of the original
     MicroEmacs 3.8 with much enhanced capability.
   * Small memory and disk footprint.
   * A much enhanced version of the Danial Lawrence's original MicroEmacs 3.8
     of 1988. It is stressed that although Danial Lawrence's 3.8 version was
     used as a base, he has had no involvement in the development of this
     distribution.
   * To avoid any confusion with the original MicroEmacs, this distribution
     should be referred to as the JASSPA distribution.
