# This script launches Jext, the Java text editor.
# It checks for a $HOME/.jext directory and eventually creates it.
# Next it checks for a /etc/jextrc and $JEXT_CONFFILE (~/.jext/variables) files which define the JEXT_HOME JAVA_CMD JAVA_OPT CLASSPATH and ToShow variables. The first is system wide(used in RPM install mainly), the second is per user.
# If this file doesn't exist the script creates it by asking the options to the user.
