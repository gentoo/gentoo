  <synopsis>
    There are multiple vulnerabilities in tcpdump and libpcap related to
    parsing of ISAKMP packets.

    <p>
    Tcpdump is a program for monitoring IP network traffic. Libpcap is a
    supporting library which is responsibile for capturing packets off a network
    interface.

  <description>
    <p>
    There are two specific vulnerabilities in tcpdump, outlined in [ reference
    1 ]. In the first scenario, an attacker may send a specially-crafted ISAKMP
    Delete packet which causes tcpdump to read past the end of its buffer. In
    the second scenario, an attacker may send an ISAKMP packet with the wrong
    payload length, again causing tcpdump to read past the end of a buffer.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    Remote attackers could potentially cause tcpdump to crash or execute
    arbitrary code as the 'pcap' user.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All tcpdump users are encouraged
    to upgrade to the latest available version.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All tcpdump users should upgrade to the latest available version.
    ADDITIONALLY, the net-libs/libpcap package should be upgraded.
    </p>
