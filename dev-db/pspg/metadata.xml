      Unix pager (with very rich functionality) designed for work with
      tables. Designed for PostgreSQL, but MySQL is supported too. Works
      well with pgcli too. Can be used as CSV or TSV viewer too. It
      supports searching, selecting rows, columns, or block and export
      selected area to clipboard.
