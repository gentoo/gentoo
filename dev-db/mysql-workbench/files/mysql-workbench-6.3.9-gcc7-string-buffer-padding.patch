For whatever reason, gcc7 insists that putting these values into
this char buffer requires 12, not 10 characters.

Furthermore, it doesn't like strcpy here, insisting it's going to
hax0r your memory or something like that.  Maybe a glibc issue?

Presumably C++ will always support putting char constants into
char[] arrays.  Someone who understands modern C++ could probably
provide a less ridiculous solution.
