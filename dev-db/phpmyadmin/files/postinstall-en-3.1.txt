If this is a new installation:

1. Configure ${PN}:

a) Create config.inc.php. You can use the web-based installer
   (this requires the 'setup' USE flag to be enabled):

   mkdir ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config
   chown ${VHOST_SERVER_UID}:${VHOST_SERVER_UID} ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config

   then go to http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/setup/

   once you've saved the configuration:

   cp ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config/config.inc.php ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config.inc.php
   rm -rf ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config

b) Alternatively, use an existing configuration:

   cp <path to existing config.inc.php file> ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/

c) Alternatively, use the sample config file:

   cp ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config.sample.inc.php ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config.inc.php

2. Be sure that the libraries/ directory is not visible. You can use the
   provided .htaccess file.

=================================================================

If you are upgrading from an earlier version:

1. If you are using ${PN}'s features for master/foreign tables, be sure to read
   http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/Documentation.html#col_com

   You will need to perform the ALTER TABLE step yourself.
