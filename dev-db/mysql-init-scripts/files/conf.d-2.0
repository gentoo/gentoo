# Depending on your usage of MySQL, you may also wish to start it after some

# you are using MySQL.

# Do your MySQL ACLs refer to hostnames not in your /etc/hosts?
# If so, you need DNS before you can accept connections.
# Avoid dependency circular loops if you use MySQL to power a local DNS server.

# Does your MySQL bind to an IP on an interface other than net.lo?
# Alternatively you might wish to specify the exact interface here.
#rc_use="net"

# Do you store your MySQL files on a SAN or other network filesystem, that is
# provided by the netmount init script?
#rc_need="netmount"

# Or from NFS? P.S. This is not a good idea in most cases, but does have some
# valid usage cases, so we provide the option.

# Should any one of the instances satisfy the requirement for MySQL coming up?
# By default, we say no.
