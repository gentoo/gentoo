		OpenDBX is an extremely lightweight but extensible database access library written in C.
		It provides an abstraction layer to all supported databases with a single, clean and simple
		interface that leads to an elegant code design automatically. If you want your application
		to support different databases with little effort, this is definitively the right thing for
		you!
