# It's not recommended to modify this file in-place, because it will be
# overwritten during package upgrades. If you want to customize, the
# best way is to create file
# "/etc/systemd/system/postgresql-@SLOT@.service.d/*.conf"
# containing your changes

# For example, if you want to change the server's port number to 5433,
# create a file named
# "/etc/systemd/system/postgresql-@SLOT@.service.d/port.conf"
# containing:
#       [Service]
#       Environment=PGPORT=5433
# This will override the setting appearing below.
