	Object-Relational Database Management System GigaBASE inherits most of the
	features of FastDB, but uses page pool instead of direct mapping of file on
	virtual memory. So GigaBASE is able to handle database, which size
	significantly exceeds size of computer physical memory. Convenient and
	flexible C++ interface makes development of application for GigaBASE very
	easy and automatic scheme evaluation simplifies maintenance and modification
	of the system. GigaBASE merges best features of relational (simple data
	structure and non-procedural query language) and object-oriented (direct
	object references, user defined types and methods) databases. GigaBASE is
	primary oriented on application requiring fast data retrieving by means of
	indices and direct object references, such as Web Server databases
	applications. SUBSQL utility can be used for database browsing and
	inspection, performing online backups, database recovery, importing data to
	and exporting data from database. GigaBASE will perform automatic recovery
	after system or application crash, you should not worry about it. The only
	thing you can have to do manually is stopping all database application if
	one of them is crashed leaving database blocked.
