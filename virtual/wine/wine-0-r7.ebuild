DESCRIPTION="Virtual for Wine that supports multiple variants and slotting"

SLOT="0"
KEYWORDS="amd64 x86"
IUSE="+abi_x86_32 +abi_x86_64 staging"

REQUIRED_USE="|| ( abi_x86_32 abi_x86_64 )"

# Note, the ordering here is intentional, to take advantage of the short-circuit
# logic of portage, to enforce wine-vanilla as default for new users.  The idea
# behind this is that some USE flags may pull in 3rd-party patchsets, so default
# of vanilla prevents that.
