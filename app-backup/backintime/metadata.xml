Back In Time is a simple backup tool for Linux inspired from “flyback project” and “TimeVault”. The backup is done by taking snapshots of a specified set of directories.
Currently there are two GUI available: Gnome and KDE 4 (&gt;= 4.1).

All you have to do is configure:
  Where to save snapshot
  What directories to backup
  When backup should be done (manual, every hour, every day, every week, every month)
