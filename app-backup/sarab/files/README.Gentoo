Gentoo GNU/Linux specific notes for SaraB
-----------------------------------------

This is the README.Gentoo file from /usr/share/doc/@PF@/ directory.

  * The Gentoo port includes more reasonable pathnames for the example
    configuration.

If you encounter any problems or have suggestions, use https://bugs.gentoo.org.
Please don't bother the upstream authors unless you are absolutely certain it is
not Gentoo-related.
