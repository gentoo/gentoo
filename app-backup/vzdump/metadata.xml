		vzdump is a utility to make consistent snapshots of running OpenVZ VEs. It basically creates a tar archive of the VE private area, which also includes the VE configuration files.
		There are several ways to provide consistency:
		- stop the VE during backup (very long downtime)
		- use rsync and suspend/resume (minimal downtime)
		- use LVM2 (no downtime)
