.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBeselect\fR is Gentoo's configuration and management tool. It features
modules that care for the individual administrative tasks.
.SH "ACTION: LIST"
\fBeselect lapack list\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.br 
Displays an ordered list of installed LAPACK implementations. It distinguishes between versions with different
Application Binary Interfaces (e.g. x86/AMD64). Furthermore, it also distinguishes
between interfaces to high-level programming languages. Each line holds
a number and the implementation's name. An asterisk next to one of the list
elements denotes an active implementation.

  [2]   reference

Possible \fIoptions\fR to the \fBlist\fR action are restrictions to
handle only certain ABI\-specific library directories. For example,
 
\fBeselect lapack list lib64\fR

lists only LAPACK implementations found in \fB/usr/lib64\fR.

.SH "ACTION: SHOW"
\fBeselect lapack show\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.br 
Shows your system's currently active LAPACK implementations.

phi / # eselect lapack show
.br 
lib: atlas
.br
lib64: reference

The same \fIoptions\fR that apply to the \fBlist\fR action can be used
with the \fBshow\fR action to restrict it to given ABIs.
.SH "ACTION: SET"
\fBeselect lapack set\fR \fIimplementation\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.br 
Sets your system's currently active LAPACK implementations to \fIimplementation\fR. 
The same \fIoptions\fR that apply to the \fBlist\fR action can be used
with the \fBset\fR action to restrict it to given ABIs.
