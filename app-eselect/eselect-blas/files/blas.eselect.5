.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBeselect\fR is Gentoo's configuration and management tool. It features
modules that care for the individual administrative tasks.
.SH "ACTION: LIST"
\fBeselect blas list\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.br 
Displays an ordered list of installed BLAS implementations. It distinguishes between versions with different
Application Binary Interfaces (e.g. x86/AMD64). Furthermore, it also distinguishes
between interfaces to high-level programming languages. Each line holds
a number and the implementation's name. An asterisk next to one of the list
elements denotes an active implementation.

  [2]   reference

Possible \fIoptions\fR to the \fBlist\fR action are restrictions to
handle only certain ABI\-specific library directories. For example,
 
\fBeselect blas list lib64\fR

lists only BLAS implementations found in \fB/usr/lib64\fR.

.SH "ACTION: SHOW"
\fBeselect blas show\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.br 
Shows your system's currently active BLAS implementations.

phi / # eselect blas show
.br 
lib: atlas
.br
lib64: reference

The same \fIoptions\fR that apply to the \fBlist\fR action can be used
with the \fBshow\fR action to restrict it to given ABIs.
.SH "ACTION: SET"
\fBeselect blas set\fR \fIimplementation\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.br 
Sets your system's currently active BLAS implementations to \fIimplementation\fR. 
The same \fIoptions\fR that apply to the \fBlist\fR action can be used
with the \fBset\fR action to restrict it to given ABIs.
