# TODO: tests are known failing with clang and needs looking into, albeit
# it is still usable at runtime save for applications segfaulting on exit
# similarly to QTBUG-90626 (not that this has in-tree revdeps as of writing
# of this). Restricting because also seen this result in hanging. Note that
# qtspeech:6 is still somewhat new (started in 6.4.0), and should review
# status on new major versions.
