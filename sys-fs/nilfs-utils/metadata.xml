NILFS is a new implementation of a log-structured file system for the
Linux 2.6 operating system. Conventional features of a log-structured
file systems (LFS) are high write performance and fast recovery time.
In addition, LFS prevents data write operations from overwriting the
disk blocks, thereby minimizing the damage to file data and system
consistency on hardware failure. Furthermore, LFS writes data and
meta-data in the correct order which helps ensuring consistency in the
entire file system. LFS can instantaneously create file system
snapshots and check the file system speedy. We implemented ``NILFS''
using modern technology: For example, the file and inode blocks are
managed by a B-tree structure, internal data are processed in 64 bit
wide word size. The B-tree structure enables ``NILFS'' to create and
store huge files.
