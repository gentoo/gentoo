  The RedirFS or redirecting file system is a layer between
  virtual file system switch (VFS) and file system drivers. It is
  implemented as an out-of-kernel module for Linux and it provides
  framework allowing modification of file system calls in the VFS
  layer. The RedirFS by itself does not provide any additional
  functionality and if it is loaded into the Linux kernel, it just
  occupies some memory space and it does practically nothing. The
  RedirFS is intended to be used by so-called filters. Filter is a
  linux kernel module (LKM) that uses the RedirFS framework. Each
  filter can add some useful functionality to the existing file
  systems like transparent compression, transparent encryption,
  merging contents of several directories into one, allowing writing
  to a read-only media and others.
