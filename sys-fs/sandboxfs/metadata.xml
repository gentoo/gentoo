		sandboxfs is a FUSE file system that exposes a combination of multiple files and directories from
		the host's file system in the form of a virtual tree with an arbitrary layout.
		You can think of a sandbox as an arbitrary view into the host's file system with different access privileges per directory.

		sandboxfs is designed to allow running commands with limited access to the file system by using the virtual tree
		as their new root, and to do so consistently across a variety of platforms.
