#/etc/dmraid: config file for adding device-mapper volumes at boot

# Format: <volume name>: <table>
# Example: isw0: 0 312602976 striped 2 128 /dev/sda 0 /dev/sdb 0
#
# Alternatively you can create all your volumes the first time, and just run:
#
#   dmsetup table >> /etc/dmtab
#
# and verify that they are correct.
