Before CacheFiles can be used, a directory for local storage
must be created.  The default configuration of /etc/cachefilesd.conf
uses /var/cache/fscache.  The filesystem mounted there must support
extended attributes (mount -o user_xattr).

Once that is taken care of, start the daemon, add -o ...,fsc
to the mount options of your network mounts, and let it fly!
