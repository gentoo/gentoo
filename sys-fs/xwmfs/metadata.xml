    This is xwmfs (X window manager file system), a userspace file system based on
    fuse that allows interaction with an EWMH compliant X11 window manager
    via files.

    Some of its features are:

    - newly appearing and disappearing windows in the X server are recognized and
      the file system is updated in an event based manner
    - new values for properties of window manager and windows will be reflected in
      the file system in an event based manner
    - properties of windows and window manager can be changed via writing to files
      in the file system
    - some X operations are accessible via control files in the file system

    The file system can be used for easily implementing scripts that operate on
    the window manager and windows (for example identifying specific windows,
    rename a window, move it around and so on).
