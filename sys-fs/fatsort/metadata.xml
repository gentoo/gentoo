	<longdescription><pkg>sys-fs/fatsort</pkg> is a utility that sorts FAT16 and FAT32 partitions. It even can
	handle long file name entries. It reads the boot sector and sorts the
	directory structure recursively. The main use case is to sort files on an
	Audio player that does not implement the sorting function itself but plays
	the files in the same order as they were copied to the disk.
