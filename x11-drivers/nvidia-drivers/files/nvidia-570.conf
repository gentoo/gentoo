#options nvidia-drm modeset=1

# If modeset=1 ^, NVIDIA will handle the console/tty display and
# allow overriding DRM devices such as simpledrm. This is a default
# since 570.x drivers but has been known to cause a variety of
# problems. Given efifb is more typically used on Gentoo at the moment,
# it is not *required* here and is safer to be disabled for now.
# Comment out the line if you need it. https://bugs.gentoo.org/949097
options nvidia-drm fbdev=0

# Disable use of the GSP firmware which has newly been enabled by default
# for GPUs that support it (Turing/Ampere+ GPUs, aka GTX 1650+). Not
# recommended unless experience regressions for which disabling helps.
# Cannot be disabled if using USE="kernel-open".
#options nvidia NVreg_EnableGpuFirmware=0

# Suspend options. Note that Allocations=1 requires suspend hooks currently
# only used when either systemd or elogind is used to suspend. If using
# neither or have issues, try Allocations=0 (revert if it does not help
# as =0 is not recommended).
