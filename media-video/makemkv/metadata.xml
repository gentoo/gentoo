      MakeMKV is your one-click solution to convert video that you own
      into free and patents-unencumbered format that can be played
      everywhere. MakeMKV is a format converter, otherwise called
      transcoder. It converts the video clips from proprietary (and
      usually encrypted) disc into a set of MKV files, preserving most
      information but not changing it in any way. The MKV format can
      store multiple video/audio tracks with all meta-information and
      preserve chapters. There are many players that can play MKV
      files nearly on all platforms, and there are tools to convert
      MKV files to many formats, including DVD and Blu-ray discs.

      Additionally MakeMKV can instantly stream decrypted video
      without intermediate conversion to wide range of players, so you
      may watch Blu-ray and DVD discs with your favorite player on
      your favorite OS or on your favorite device.
