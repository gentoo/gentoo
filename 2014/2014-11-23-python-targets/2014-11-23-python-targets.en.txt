Python 3.4 is now enabled by default, replacing Python 3.3 as the
default Python 3 interpreter.

PYTHON_TARGETS will be adjusted to contain python2_7 and python3_4 by
default via your profile.

PYTHON_SINGLE_TARGET will remain set to python2_7 by default.

If you have PYTHON_TARGETS set in make.conf, that setting will still be
respected. You may want to adjust this setting manually.

At the same time, support for Python 3.2 will be removed from the
python-r1 family of eclasses. This version no longer receives regular
bug fixes, and is currently only receiving security updates.

Once the changes have taken place, a world update should take care of
reinstalling any python libraries you have installed. You should also
switch your default python3 interpreter using eselect python.

For example:

eselect python set --python3 python3.4
emerge -uDv --changed-use @world
