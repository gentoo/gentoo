WhySynth is a versatile softsynth which operates as a plugin for the DSSI Soft Synth Interface. A brief list of features:
4 oscillators, 2 filters, 3 LFOs, and 5 envelope generators per voice.
11 oscillator modes: minBLEP, wavecycle, chorused wavecycle, asynchronous granular, three FM modes, waveshaper, noise, PADsynth, and phase distortion.
10 filter modes.
flexible modulation and mixdown options, plus effects.
DSSI is a plugin API for software instruments (soft synths) with user interfaces, permitting them to be hosted in-process by audio applications. More information on DSSI can be found at:
http://dssi.sourceforge.net/
WhySynth is something of a mongrel, combining bits from Xsynth-DSSI, hexter, Csound, Mats Olsson's MSS, and various other programs, with inspiration from a number of my favorite long-hair-days synths (Matrix 6, ESQ-1, K4), and wavecycle data resynthesized from Claude Kaber's Virtual K4 samples and //christian's exegesis of the Ensoniq SQ-80 wavetable ROMs. See the enclosed file AUTHORS for more details.
