# /etc/conf.d/vdr.markad

# Configuration:

#  A few settings are given on the command line rather than in the setup menu.
#  Available options:
#
#    -b DIR,   --bindir=DIR          use DIR as location for markad executable
#                                    (default: /usr/bin)
#    -l DIR    --logocachedir=DIR    use DIR as location for markad logos
#                                    (default: /var/lib/markad)
#
#              --loglevel=<level>    sets log level of started markad process (standalone, not the plugin) to the specified value
#                                    <level>: 1=error 2=info 3=debug 4=trace
#
#              --astopoffs=SECONDS   assume stop of the recording SECONDS after the end of the EPG time.
#                                    default is 0 s
#                                    If end marks are to early, try to add some seconds
#
#              --cut                 cut video based on marks and write it in the recording directory
#                                    there are no splits of the target file, make sure your filesystem can handle big files
#
#              --ac3reencode         re-encode AC3 stream to fix low audio level of cutted video on same devices
#                                    requires --cut
#
#              --autologo=<option>   0 = disable, only use logos from logo cache directory
#                                    1 = deprecated, do not use
#                                    2 = enable (default)
#                                        if there is no suitable logo in the logo cache directory markad will
#                                        try to find the logo from recording and store it in the recording directory
#                                        If this option is set you can not configure this feature from the VDR menu
