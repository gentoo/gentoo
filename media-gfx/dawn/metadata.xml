  Fukui Renderer DAWN (Drawer for Academic WritiNgs) 
  is a renderer, which reads 3D geometrical data and visualize them.  
  It is a vectorized 3D PostScript processor with analytical 
  hidden line/surface removal. 
  It aims at precise technical drawing of complicated objects.  
  It performs geometrical hidden line/surface removal and calculates 
  out all visible parts of the 3D data before drawing.  This drawing 
  algorithm realizes device-independent technical high quality of
  vectorized graphics.
    3D Data files should be generated by a modeler or by hands 
  separately.  If you use DAWN as a visualizer of, 
  say, a simulator of physical experiments, 
  the simulator application itself is recognized as a modeler.
    An important feature of DAWN is that it has been developed to
  visualize 3D data generated by a high-energy experimental detector
  simulator "GEANT4".
