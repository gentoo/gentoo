YafaRay is a raytracing open source render engine. Raytracing is a rendering technique for generating realistic images by tracing the path of light through a 3D scene.
An render engine consists of a "faceless" computer program that interacts with a host 3D application to provide very specific raytracing capabilties "on demand". Blender 3D is the host application of YafaRay.
