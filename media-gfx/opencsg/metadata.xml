		OpenCSG is a library that does image-based CSG rendering using
		OpenGL. OpenCSG is written in C++ and supports most modern
		graphics hardware using Microsoft Windows or the Linux operating
		system.  What is CSG, anyway? CSG is short for Constructive Solid
		Geometry and denotes an approach to model complex 3D-shapes using
		simpler ones. I.e., two shapes can be combined by taking the union
		of them, by intersecting them, or by subtracting one shape of the
		other.  SG is often used as fundamental modeling technique in CAD/CAM
		applications. Here, image-based CSG rendering is the key to
		interactively manipulate CSG shapes. Since OpenCSG renders even
		complex CSG shapes fast, it can be advantageously used in such
		applications.  The OpenCSG library requires graphics hardware that
		either supports frame buffer objects or PBuffers in OpenGL.
