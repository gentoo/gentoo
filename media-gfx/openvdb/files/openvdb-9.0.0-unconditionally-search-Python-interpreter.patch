Subject: [PATCH] cmake: unconditionally search for Python interpreter

When setting PYOPENVDB_INSTALL_DIRECTORY, CMake would fail with:
```
-- Could NOT find Python (missing: Python_LIBRARIES Development Development.Module Development.Embed) (found version "3.9.9")
CMake Error at openvdb/openvdb/python/CMakeLists.txt:65 (message):
  Could NOT find Python::Module (Required is at least version "2.7")
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  openvdb/openvdb/python/CMakeLists.txt:112 (openvdb_check_python_version)
```

It seems like we always need to search for the interpreter.
