		XPaint is an X Window System color image bitmap editing program.
		It also supports advanced features, such as image processing
		algorithms, scripting and batch jobs. XPaint allows the edition
		of multiple images simultaneously and supports a wide variety of
		image formats, including: GIF, JPG, PNG, PPM, TIFF, XBM, XPM,
		etc.

		xpaint is now fully UTF8 compliant, and is capable of using
		antialiased truetype fonts in its operations and in the menus
		(in particular, translating to oriental languages should now be
		quite easy - also the X core font protocol is no longer used
		anywhere.)

		xpaint also offers optional editing features based on
		programmable filters and user defined procedures written as
		scripts in plain C. The package includes a substantial list of
		examples and some support for batch processing.
