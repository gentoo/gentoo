		This is the software that will drive your MakerBot Replicator, 
		Thing-O-Matic, CupCake CNC, RepRap machine, or generic CNC machine. 
		You can give it a GCode or STL file to process, and it takes it from 
		there. It's cross platform, easily installed, and is based on the 
		familiar Arduino / Processing environments. ReplicatorG is used by 
		thousands of MakerBot Operators, and has printed tens of thousands 
		of objects and counting.
