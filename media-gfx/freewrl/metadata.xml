FreeWRL is a VRML97 (VRML-2.0) and X3D interactive viewer, providing both a traditional Xorg application 
and a nsbrowser plugin for use with many available web browsers.  The package depends heavily on OpenGL 
support for rendering.  When developing your 3D world or model, you can program with GLSL Shaders using the 
X3D Shaders Component, put your model exactly where you want them with the Geospatial Component, or just 
throw triangles to the screen as Extrusions, IndexedFaceSets, TriangleSets, Circle2D, Disk2D, Spheres, Boxes, 
Cubes; the list goes on and on.  With royalty free open standards, your models will continue to render, year after year.
