		OpenMesh is a generic and efficient data structure for representing and
		manipulating polygonal meshes. OpenMesh is developed at the Computer Graphics
		Group, RWTH Aachen, as part of the  OpenSGPlus project, is funded by the
		German Ministry for Research and Education (BMBF), and will serve as
		geometry kernel upon which the so-called high level primitives (e.g.
		subdivision surfaces or progressive meshes) of OpenSGPlus are built.
