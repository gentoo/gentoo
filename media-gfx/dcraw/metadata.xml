		This utility converts the native (RAW), format of various digital cameras into
		netpbm portable pixmap (.ppm) image. Supports the following models: Canon,
		Kodak, Olympus, Nikon, Fuji, Minolta and Sigma (see
		http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/ for full list) Note: This utility does
		not read directly from the cameras, only the files after they have been
		downloaded, use gphoto2 for that.
