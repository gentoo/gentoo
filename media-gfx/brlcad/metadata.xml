  BRL-CAD is a Combinatorial/Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)
  solid modeling system that includes an interactive geometry editor,
  ray-tracing support for rendering and geometric analysis,
  network-distributed framebuffer support, image and signal-processing
  tools, and an embedded scripting language.
  
  The package is a collection of over 400 tools and utilities. Included
  is support for various geometric data format conversions, image and
  signal processing capabilities, ray-tracing based lighting models,
  network distributed ray-tracing, parallel ray-tracing, animation
  capabilities, data compression, image handling, and interactive 3-D
  geometric editing, and also an implementation of Weiler's n-Manifold
  Geometry (NMG) data structures for surface-based solid models and
  photon mapping.
