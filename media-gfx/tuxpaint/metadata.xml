  Tux Paint is a free drawing program designed for young children
  (kids ages 3 and up). It has a simple, easy-to-use interface, fun
  sound effects, and an encouraging cartoon mascot who helps guide
  children as they use the program. It provides a blank canvas and a
  variety of drawing tools to help your child be creative.
