    Solvespace is a parametric 2D/3D CAD tool. Applications include:
    - modeling 3d parts — draw with extrudes, revolves, and Boolean (union / difference) operations
    - modeling 2d parts — draw the part as a single section, and export DXF, PDF, SVG; use 3d assembly to verify fit
    - 3d-printed parts — export the STL or other triangle mesh expected by most 3d printers
    - preparing CAM data — export 2d vector art for a waterjet machine or laser cutter;
      or generate STEP or STL, for import into third-party CAM software for machining
    - mechanism design — use the constraint solver to simulate planar or spatial linkages, with pin, ball, or slide joints
    - plane and solid geometry — replace hand-solved trigonometry and spreadsheets with a live dimensioned drawing
