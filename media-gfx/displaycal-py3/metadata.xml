    This project intended to modernize the DisplayCAL code including Python 3 support.
    Florian HÃ¶ch, the original developer, did an incredible job of creating and maintaining DisplayCAL for all these years.
    But, it seems that, during the pandemic, very understandably, he lost his passion to the project.
    Now, it is time for us, the DisplayCAL community, to contribute back to this great tool.
