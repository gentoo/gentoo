iGal2 needs Perl to run and either cjpeg/djpeg/pnmscale (from libjpeg) 
or ImageMagick or GraphicksMagick to generate your thumbnails. 
These come standard with most Linux distributions today.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install from the tarball (as root)
    make install

By default, this will put the relevant files in «/usr/local».
(e.g. «/usr/local/bin» and «/usr/local/share/igal2»)
You can change this destination by using «PREFIX=/<some/path/here>»
in the make install argument.

To install this in /usr (/usr/bin and /usr/share/igal2)
run «make PREFIX=/usr install».

To uninstall from the tarball (as root)
    make uninstall

------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPGRADE from version 1.4 (and older):
igal2 supports a lot of new features and therefore the format of the
template files had to be changed. igal2 installs all its template
files under /usr/local/lib/igal2.  Please add your design changes there.

If you want to use igal and igal2 side by side, please be sure not
to overwrite "igal" when asked through the install script.

As igal (1.4) stores all necessary templates and files within the image
directory you may savely delete all old igal 1.4 (or older) files when
satisfied with igal2.

This can be done with 
    make old-clean
