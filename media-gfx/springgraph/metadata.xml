<longdescription> Springgraph will read in a .dot file description of a graph,
    which, for each node, specifies its name and which other nodes it is
    connected to, and then renders a graph. Each node is drawn as an ellipse,
    and each connection is drawn as an arrow. The node placement is a result of
    all of the nodes moving away from each other, while all nodes which are
    connected move toward each other. This movement is repeated until it
    stabilizes.</longdescription>
