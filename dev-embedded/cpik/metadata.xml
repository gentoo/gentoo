		CPIK (the C compiler for PIC18 devices) is released under the GPL licence.
		CPIK is an easy to use, near ANSI C compiler which is fully integrated with
		PikDev. This project is still in progress but near to be finished and the
		current version is perfectly usable. (from Pikdev or from a command-line
		interpreter).
