		EasyChem is a program designed to draw chemical molecules, written under
		Linux using Gtk+ 2.4. It is implemented with a strong focus on producing
		press quality molecules. Easychem can be a little more difficult to learn to
		use, but when mastered it can be very fast and powerful. It can draw
		ornaments easily, and exports to EPS with LaTeX fonts among other things.
