Cluster is a simple UNIX C++ program to build lists of collections
of interacting items from records containing interacting pairs
and larger fragments.

It reads in lines consisting of two or more names and output
connected clusters of names. Each line of output is
prefixed with a cluster number, the size of the cluster
and an optional name string.
