Crystallography and NMR System (CNS) is the result of an international
collaborative effort among several research groups. The program has 
been designed to provide a flexible multi-level hierachical approach for the
most commonly used algorithms in macromolecular structure determination. 
Highlights include heavy atom searching, experimental phasing (including 
MAD and MIR), density modification, crystallographic refinement with maximum
likelihood targets, and NMR structure calculation using NOEs, J-coupling, 
chemical shift, and dipolar coupling data.
