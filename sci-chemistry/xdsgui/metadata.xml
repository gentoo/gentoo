XDSgui is a GUI (graphical user interface) for XDS that is supposed to help both
novice and experienced users. It graphically displays the ASCII and cbf files 
that XDS writes, and can run useful shell commands with a simple mouse click. 
The design goal of the program is to enable XDS data processing without the 
commandline, and to supply additional graphical information.
