MoleQueue is an open-source, cross-platform, system-tray resident desktop 
application for abstracting, managing, and coordinating the execution of tasks 
both locally and on remote computational resources. It is built and tested and 
Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows, with nightly binaries currently available for 
Mac OS X and Windows. Users can set up local and remote queues that describe 
where the task will be executed. Each queue can have programs, with templates 
to facilitate the execution of the program. Input files can be staged, and 
output files collected using a standard interface.
