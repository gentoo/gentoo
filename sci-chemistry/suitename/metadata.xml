Suitename is a new C program that supports the ROC RNA Ontology Consortium 
consensus RNA backbone nomenclature and conformer-list development (see our RNA 
backbone rotamer section.
From dihedral-angle input for a specific RNA structure (usually from Dangle), 
Suitename categorizes the RNA backbone geometry of each suite (the 
sugar-to-sugar version of a residue) either as an outlier ("!!") or as belonging
to one of the 53 defined conformer bins. The output is either a 
one-line-per-suite report, or a linear conformer string (as shown below the 
image here) in one of several variant formats. Suitename is built into 
MolProbity, producing entries in the multi-criterion chart for an RNA model and 
also a suitestring file. The Suitename code is made available here for bulk or 
individual command-line use.
