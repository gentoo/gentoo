	PRODECOMP (PROjection DECOMPosition) is a software tool for 
	decomposition of 2D projections of high-dimensional NMR spectra to a set
	of components (defined in turn by one-dimensional "shapes"). 
	Simultaneous analysis of projections from one or several 
	high-dimensional experiments provide unambigous chemical shifts for 
	large spin systems. The latter can be used for backbone and side-chain 
	assignments as well as structural studies of proteins 
	(Malmodin and Billeter 2005; 2006; Staykova et al. 2008a,b).
