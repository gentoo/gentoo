  <longdescription lang="en">
    The Semigroups package is a GAP package for semigroups, and
    monoids. There are particularly efficient methods for finitely
    presented semigroups and monoids, and for semigroups and monoids
    consisting of transformations, partial permutations, bipartitions,
    partitioned binary relations, subsemigroups of regular Rees 0-matrix
    semigroups, and matrices of various semirings including boolean
    matrices, matrices over finite fields, and certain tropical
    matrices. Semigroups contains efficient methods for creating
    semigroups, monoids, and inverse semigroups and monoids, calculating
    their Green's structure, ideals, size, elements, group of units,
    small generating sets, testing membership, finding the inverses of a
    regular element, factorizing elements over the generators, and so
    on. It is possible to test if a semigroup satisfies a particular
    property, such as if it is regular, simple, inverse, completely
    regular, and a large number of further properties. There are methods
    for finding presentations for a semigroup, the congruences of a
    semigroup, the maximal subsemigroups of a finite semigroup, smaller
    degree partial permutation representations, and the character tables
    of inverse semigroups. There are functions for producing pictures of
    the Green's structure of a semigroup, and for drawing graphical
    representations of certain types of elements.
