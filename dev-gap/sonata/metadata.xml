    SONATA stands for "systems of nearrings and their applications." It
    provides methods for the construction and the analysis of finite
    nearrings:

     * Methods for constructing all endomorphisms and all
       fixed-point-free automorphisms of a given group.

     * Methods for constructing the following nearrings of functions on
       a group G: the nearring of polynomial functions of G (in the sense
       of Lausch-Nöbauer); the nearring of compatible functions of G;
       distributively generated nearrings such as I(G), A(G), E(G);
       centralizer nearrings.

       * A library of all small nearrings (up to order 15) and all small
         nearrings with identity (up to order 31).

       * Functions to obtain solvable fixed-point-free automorphism
         groups on abelian groups, nearfields, planar nearrings, as well
         as designs from those.

       * Various functions to study the structure (size, ideals,
         N-groups, ...) of nearrings, to determine properties of nearring
         elements, and to decide whether two nearrings are isomorphic.

       * If the package XGAP is installed, the lattices of one- and
         two-sided ideals of a nearring can be studied interactively using
         a graphical representation
