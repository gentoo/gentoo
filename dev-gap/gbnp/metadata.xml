  <longdescription lang="en">
    The GBNP package provides algorithms for computing Grobner bases of
    noncommutative polynomials with coefficients from a field
    implemented in GAP and with respect to the "total degree first then
    lexicographical" ordering. Further provided are some variations,
    such as a weighted and truncated version and a tracing facility. The
    word "algorithm" is to be interpreted loosely here: in general one
    cannot expect such an algorithm to terminate, as it would imply
    solvability of the word problem for finitely presented (semi)groups.
