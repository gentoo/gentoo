    LieAlgDB provides access to several classifications of Lie algebras.
    In the mathematics literature many classifications of Lie algebras
    of various types have been published. This package aims at making a
    few classifications of small dimensional Lie algebras that have
    appeared in recent years more accessible. For each classification
    that is contained in the package, functions are provided that
    construct Lie algebras from that classification inside GAP. This
    allows the user to obtain easy access to the often rather
    complicated data contained in a classification, and to directly
    interface the Lie algebras to the functionality for Lie algebras
    which is already contained in GAP.
