	<longdescription>The DBusKit framework offers tight integration of D-Bus services into Objective-C applications. It handles all low-level details of communication with D-Bus daemons and the services connected to them and exposes an interface similar to Distributed Objects to make it easy for Objective-C programmers to access D-Bus services.</longdescription>
