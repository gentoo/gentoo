NetHogs is a small 'net top' tool. Instead of breaking the traffic down
 per protocol or per subnet, like most tools do, it groups bandwidth by 
process. NetHogs does not rely on a special kernel module to be loaded. 
If there's suddenly a lot of network traffic, you can fire up NetHogs and 
immediately see which PID is causing this. This makes it easy to indentify 
programs that have gone wild and are suddenly taking up your bandwidth.
