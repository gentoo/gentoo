		The arpwatch package contains arpwatch and arpsnmp. Arpwatch and arpsnmp
		are both network monitoring tools. Both utilities monitor Ethernet or
		FDDI network traffic and build databases of Ethernet/IP address pairs,
		and can report certain changes via email.  Install the arpwatch package
		if you need networking monitoring devices which will automatically keep
		track of the IP addresses on your network.
