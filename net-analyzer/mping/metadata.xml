UNINETTs delay statistics for IPv6 is now up and 
running as a test project. The main goal with this 
test project,is to test how well
Mping 2.0 works against the IPv6 network, and how well 
it handles IPv4 and IPv6 adresses simultaniously. For 
now we have to
resort to "IPv6 over IPv4 tunneling", but this is not 
a permanent solution.
