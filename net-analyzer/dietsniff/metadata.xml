dietsniff is a network-debugging tool like tcpdump or ethereal. The
difference to those powerful tools however is that dietsniff is linked
against Felix von Leitner's dietlibc and doesn't require libpcap.
Therefore it's really small while being static. dietsniff's most
useful scenario is probably to sniff the packets into a pcap-logfile which
can be later viewed using more user friendly applications.
