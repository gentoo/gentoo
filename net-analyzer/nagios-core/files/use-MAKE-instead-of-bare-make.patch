Subject: [PATCH 1/1] Use $(MAKE) instead of bare "make" in subtarget of
 install-html.

When running make as a subprocess of itself, it's best to invoke it as
$(MAKE). The rest of Makefile.in does this correctly, but there was
one instance where it was forgotten. For posterity, this can lead to
warnings like,

  make[1]: warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1.
  Add '+' to parent make rule.
