    Nagios is a host and service monitor designed to inform you of
    network problems before your clients, end-users or managers do. It
    has been designed to run under the Linux operating system, but
    works fine under most *NIX variants as well. The monitoring daemon
    runs intermittent checks on hosts and services you specify using
    external "plugins" which return status information to Nagios. When
    problems are encountered, the daemon can send notifications out to
    administrative contacts in a variety of different ways (email,
    instant message, SMS, etc.). Current status information,
    historical logs, and reports can all be accessed via a web
    browser.
