    This program is designed to accept passive service check results
    from clients that use the send_nsca utility (which is included in
    this package) and pass them along to the Nagios process by using
    the external command interface. The program can either be run as a
    standalone daemon or as a service under inetd. If you have
    libmcrypt installed on your systems, you can choose from multiple
    crypto algorithms (DES, 3DES, CAST, xTEA, Twofish, LOKI97,
    RJINDAEL, SERPENT, GOST, SAFER/SAFER+, etc.) for encrypting the
    traffic between the client and the server.  Encryption is
    important in this addon, as it prevents unauthorized users from
    sending bogus check results to Nagios. Read the included SECURITY
    document for more information.

    This package provides the send_nsca utility running on the client.

    <flag name="crypt">
      Build support for crypted communication with nsca, through
      <pkg>dev-libs/mcrypt</pkg>. It's recommended not to disable this
      flag unless all the communication will be handled in an
      absolutely safe environment.
    </flag>
    <flag name="minimal">
      Only build and install the send_nsca command and not the
      daemon. This allows a very minimal install with no overhead when
      setting up a node.
