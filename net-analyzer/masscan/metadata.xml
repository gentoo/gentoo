 This is the fastest Internet port scanner. It can scan the
 entire Internet in under 6 minutes, transmitting 10 million
 packets per second.
 
 It produces results similar to nmap, the most famous port
 scanner. Internally, it operates more like scanrand,
 unicornscan, and ZMap, using asynchronous transmission.
 The major difference is that it's faster than these other
 scanners. In addition, it's more flexible, allowing
 arbitrary address ranges and port ranges.
