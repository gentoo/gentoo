		Prelude-Correlator allows conducting multi-stream correlations
		thanks to a powerful programming language for writing correlation
		rules. With any type of alert able to be correlated, event
		analysis becomes simpler, quicker and more incisive. This
		correlation alert then appears within the Prewikka interface
		and indicates the potential target information via the set of
		correlation rules.
