		Spine (formerly known as Cactid) is a poller for Cacti that primarily
		strives to be as fast as possible. For this reason it is written in
		native C, makes use of POSIX threads, and is linked directly against the
		net-snmp library for minmumal SNMP polling overhead. Spine is a
		replacement for the default cmd.php poller so you must decide if using
		Spine makes sense for your installation.
