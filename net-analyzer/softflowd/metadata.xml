	softflowd is a software implementation of a flow-based network traffic
	monitor.  softflowd reads network traffic and gathers information about
	active traffic flows.  A "traffic flow" is communication between two IP
	addresses or (if the overlying protocol is TCP or UDP) address/port tuples.
	The intended use of softflowd is as a software implementation of Ciscoâ€™s
	NetFlow traffic account system.  softflowd supports data export using
	versions 1, 5 or 9 of the NetFlow protocol.
