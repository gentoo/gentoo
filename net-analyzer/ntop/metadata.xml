  <longdescription>ntop is a network traffic probe that shows the network usage,
  similar to what the popular top Unix command does. ntop is based on libpcap
  and it has been written in a portable way in order to virtually run on every
  Unix platform and on Win32 as well.
  ntop users can use a a web browser (e.g. netscape) to navigate through ntop
  (that acts as a web server) traffic information and get a dump of the network
  status. In the latter case, ntop can be seen as a simple RMON-like agent with an
  embedded web interface.</longdescription>
