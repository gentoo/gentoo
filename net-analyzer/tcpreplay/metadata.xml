  Tcpreplay is a suite of utilities for UNIX systems for editing and replaying
  network traffic which was previously captured by tools like tcpdump and
  ethereal/wireshark. The goal of tcpreplay is to provide the means for
  providing reliable and repeatible means for testing a variety of network
  devices such as switches, router, firewalls, network intrusion detection and
  prevention systems (IDS and IPS).
