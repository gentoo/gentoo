		NetPIPE is a protocol independent performance tool that visually
		represents the network performance under a variety of conditions.
		It performs simple ping-pong tests, bouncing messages of increasing
		size between two processes, whether across a network or within an
		SMP system. Message sizes are chosen at regular intervals, and with
		slight perturbations, to provide a complete test of the communication
		system. Each data point involves many ping-pong tests to provide an
		accurate timing. Latencies are calculated by dividing the round
		trip time in half for small messages ( less 64 Bytes ).
