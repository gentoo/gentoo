# The following options are now set in your snort.conf file:
# config set_gid:
# config set_uid:
# config snaplen:
# config bpf_file:
# config logdir:

# The only options that should be set here are SNORT_IFACE and SNORT_CONF.

# This tell snort which interface to listen on (any for every interface)
SNORT_IFACE="eth1"

# Probably not this either
