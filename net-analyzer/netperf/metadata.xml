Netperf is a benchmark that can be used to measure the performance of many
different types of networking. It provides tests for both unidirectional
throughput, and end-to-end latency. The environments currently measureable by
netperf include:

 - TCP and UDP via BSD Sockets for both IPv4 and IPv6
 - DLPI
 - Unix Domain Sockets
 - SCTP for both IPv4 and IPv6
