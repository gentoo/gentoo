=head1 NAME

rrdrados - Creating, updating and retrieving RRD files from Ceph

=head1 SYNOPSIS

E<lt>rrdfileE<gt> = B<ceph//E<lt>nameE<gt>>


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds support for creating, updating and retrieving RRD files
directly from a Ceph cluster using librados.

It adds a ceph// prefix to RRD file name which is used to instruct rrdtool to
operate on a file that is stored in Ceph.

Currently the module expects to find the Ceph configuration file in the default
location at /etc/ceph/ceph.conf. By default it uses Ceph client ID "admin" and a
Ceph pool named "rrd".


=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

=over 4

=item B<CEPH_ID>

Sets the Ceph Client ID to use when connecting. By default the client ID "admin"
is used.

=item B<CEPH_POOL>

Sets the name of the Ceph Pool to connect to. By default, the pool "rrd" is
used.

=head1 EXAMPLES

B<Creating an RRD file on Ceph>

 rrdtool create ceph//temperature.rrd --step 300 \
   DS:temp:GAUGE:600:-273:5000 \
   RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:1200 \
   RRA:MIN:0.5:12:2400 \
   RRA:MAX:0.5:12:2400 \
   RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:12:2400


B<Importing an existing RRD into Ceph>

 rrdtool dump existing.rrd | rrdtool restore - ceph//new.rrd

Or you could also copy the RRD file directly into Ceph using the rados command
line utility.


B<Retrieving RRD data from Ceph>

 rrdtool fetch ceph//file.rrd AVERAGE
