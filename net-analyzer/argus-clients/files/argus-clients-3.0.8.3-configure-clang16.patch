Subject: [PATCH] configure (AC_LBL_UNALIGNED_ACCESS): Avoid implicit function
 decls

Implicit function declarations were removed from the C language
in 1999.  Include the relevant header files to ensure that the
check still works with future compilers.  C99 also requires
to declare the return types of all functions.
