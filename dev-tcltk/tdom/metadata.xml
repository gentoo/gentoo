  tDOM combines high performance XML data processing with easy and
  powerful Tcl scripting functionality. tDOM should be one of the fastest
  ways to manipulate XML with a scripting language and uses very few
  memory: for example, the DOM tree of the XML recommendation in XML
  (160K) needs only about 450K of memory.
