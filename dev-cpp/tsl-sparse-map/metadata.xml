    A C++ implementation of a memory efficient hash map and hash set.

    The sparse-map library is a C++ implementation of a memory efficient hash
    map and hash set. It uses open-addressing with sparse quadratic probing. The
    goal of the library is to be the most memory efficient possible, even at low
    load factor, while keeping reasonable performances. You can find an article
    of Stephen Merity which explains the idea behind google::sparse_hash_map and
    this project.
