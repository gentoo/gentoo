		ODB is an open-source, cross-platform, and cross-database
		object-relational mapping (ORM) system for C++. It allows you
		to persist C++ objects to a relational database without having
		to deal with tables, columns, or SQL and without manually
		writing any mapping code. ODB supports MySQL, SQLite,
		PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server relational
		databases as well as C++98/03 and C++11 language standards. It
		also comes with optional profiles for Boost and Qt which allow
		you to seamlessly use value types, containers, and smart
		pointers from these libraries in your persistent C++ classes.
