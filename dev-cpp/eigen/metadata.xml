		Eigen is a lightweight C++ template library for vector and matrix math,
		a.k.a. linear algebra. Unlike most other linear algebra libraries, Eigen
		focuses on the simple mathematical needs of applications: games and other
		OpenGL apps, spreadsheets and other office apps, etc. Eigen is dedicated to
		providing optimal speed with GCC.
