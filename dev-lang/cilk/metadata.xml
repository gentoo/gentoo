<longdescription lang="en">
  Cilk is a language for multithreaded parallel programming based on
  ANSI C. Cilk is especially effective for exploiting dynamic, highly
  asynchronous parallelism, which can be difficult to write in data-parallel or
  message-passing style. Cilk provides an effective platform for
  programming dense and sparse numerical algorithms, such as matrix
  factorization and N-body simulations. Cilk is algorithmic, in that
  the runtime system employs a scheduler that allows the performance
  of programs to be estimated accurately based on abstract complexity
  measures.
