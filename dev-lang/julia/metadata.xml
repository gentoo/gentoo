  Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for
  technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other
  technical computing environments. It provides a sophisticated
  compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an
  extensive mathematical function library. The library, mostly written
  in Julia itself, also integrates mature, best-of-breed C and Fortran
  libraries for linear algebra, random number generation, FFTs, and
  string processing. Julia programs are organized around defining
  functions, and overloading them for different combinations of
  argument types (which can also be user-defined).
