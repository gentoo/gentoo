  <longdescription>
    Neko is a high-level dynamically typed programming language. It can be
    used as an embedded scripting language. It has been designed to provide
    a common runtime for several different languages. Learning and using
    Neko is very easy. You can easily extend the language with C libraries.
    You can also write generators from your own language to Neko and then
    use the Neko Runtime to compile, run, and access existing libraries.
