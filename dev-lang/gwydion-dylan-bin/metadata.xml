Dylan is an advanced, object-oriented, dynamic language which supports the rapid
development of programs. When needed, the programmer can later optimize [his or
her] programs for more efficient execution by supplying type information to the
compiler. Nearly all entities in Dylan (including functions, classes, and basic
data types such as integers) are first class objects. Additionally Dylan
supports multiple inheritance, polymorphism, multiple dispatch, keyword
arguments, object introspection, and many other advanced features.
