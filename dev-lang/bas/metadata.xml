    Bas is an interpreter for the classic dialect of the programming
    language BASIC. It is pretty compatible to typical BASIC interpreters of
    the 1980s, unlike some other UNIX BASIC interpreters, that implement a
    different syntax, breaking compatibility to existing programs. Bas
    offers many ANSI BASIC statements for structured programming, such as
    procedures, local variables and various loop types. Further there are
    matrix operations, automatic LIST indentation and many statements and
    functions found in specific classic dialects. Line numbers are not
    required. Bas is written in ANSI C for UNIX systems.
