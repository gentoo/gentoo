  <longdescription>
    ATS is a statically typed programming language that unifies implementation
    with formal specification. It is equipped with a highly expressive type
    system rooted in the framework Applied Type System, which gives the
    language its name. In particular, both dependent types and linear types are
    available in ATS. ATS2 extends ATS with an advanced template system,
    allowing functional programming to be employed in a setting where only bare
    minimal run-time support is available. In addition, the template system
    makes ATS2 highly suitable for supporting numerical computation.
