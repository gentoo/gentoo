		PICO-8 is a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games
		and other computer programs. When you turn it on, the machine greets you
		with a shell for typing in Lua programs and provides simple built-in
		tools for creating sprites, maps and sound.

		The harsh limitations of PICO-8 are carefully chosen to be fun to work
		with, encourage small but expressive designs and hopefully to give
		PICO-8 cartridges their own particular look and feel.
