  Maude is a high-performance reflective language and system supporting
  both equational and rewriting logic specification and programming for a
  wide range of applications. Maude has been influenced in important ways
  by the OBJ3 language, which can be regarded as an equational logic
  sublanguage. Besides supporting equational specification and
  programming, Maude also supports rewriting logic computation.
