    Fennel is a lisp that compiles to Lua. It aims to be easy to use,
    expressive, and has almost zero overhead compared to handwritten Lua.
    Full Lua compatibility - You can use any function or library from Lua.
    Zero overhead - Compiled code should be just as or more efficient
    than hand-written Lua.
    Compile-time macros - Ship compiled code with no runtime dependency
    on Fennel.
    Embeddable - Fennel is a one-file library as well as an executable.
    Embed it in other programs to support runtime extensibility and
    interactive development.
    At https://fennel-lang.org there's a live in-browser REPL you can use
    without installing anything.
