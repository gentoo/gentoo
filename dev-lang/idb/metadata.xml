  The IntelÂ® Debugger is a command line debugger for Intel based
  architectures. It is well suited with the Intel C++ or Intel FORTRAN
  compilers. It also comes also with a graphical interface and extensive
  documentation. The package is bundled in either compiler tar ball, and
  has been split to produce this one.
  The product can be installed as a non-commercial as
  well. License, terms of qualifications can be found on the web
