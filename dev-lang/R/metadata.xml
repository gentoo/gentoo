  R is GNU S, a system for statistical computation and graphics. It
  consists of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a
  debugger, access to certain system functions, and the ability to run
  programs stored in script files.

  The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows
  branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.
  The R distribution contains functionality for a large number of
  statistical procedures such as: linear and generalized linear
  models, nonlinear regression models, time series analysis, classical
  parametric and nonparametric tests, clustering, smoothing and
  graphical data representations. Additional modules ("add-on
  packages") are available for a variety of specific purposes but are
  not distributed with this package.
