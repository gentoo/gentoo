		R is GNU S, a system for statistical computation and graphics. It
		consists of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a
		debugger, access to certain system functions, and the ability to run
		programs stored in script files.

		The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows
		branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.
		The R distribution contains functionality for a large number of
		statistical procedures such as: linear and generalized linear
		models, nonlinear regression models, time series analysis, classical
		parametric and nonparametric tests, clustering, smoothing and
		graphical data representations. Additional modules ("add-on
		packages") are available for a variety of specific purposes but are
		not distributed with this package.
