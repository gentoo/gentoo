    Arc is designed for exploratory programming: the kind where you
    decide what to write by writing it. A good medium for exploratory
    programming is one that makes programs brief and malleable,
    so that's what we've aimed for. This is a medium for sketching
    software.
    Arc is unfinished. It's missing things you'd need to solve some
    types of problems. But it works well for basic web apps.
