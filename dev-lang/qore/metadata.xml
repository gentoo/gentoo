  <longdescription>
    The Qore programming language is a powerful, thread-capable, embeddable
    weakly-typed language with optional strong typing and procedural and
    object-oriented features designed for anything from quick scripting to
    complex multithreaded, network-aware application development to embedded
    application scripting. Qore was initially designed to facilitate the rapid
    implementation of sophisticated interfaces in embedded code in an
    enterprise environment, and has since grown into a general-purpose language
    as well.
