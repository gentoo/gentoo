<longdescription>
  An implementation of the language INTERCAL, legendary for its perversity
  and horribleness (this version adds COME FROM for extra flavor). Comes with
  language manual and examples including possibly the entire extant body of
  INTERCAL code. Now supports i18n and l14n (to Ancient Roman locale only).
  Now with fix patch by Donald Knuth.
