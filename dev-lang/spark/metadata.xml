		SPARK is a software development technology specifically designed for
		engineering high-reliability applications. It consists of a programming
		language, a verification toolset and a design method which, taken
		together, ensure that ultra-low defect software can be deployed in
		application domains where high-reliability must be assured, for example
		where safety and security are key requirements.
