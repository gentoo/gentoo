  <longdescription>
    Boogie is an intermediate verification language (IVL), intended as a layer
    on which to build program verifiers for other languages. Several program
    verifiers have been built in this way, including the VCC and HAVOC
    verifiers for C and the verifiers for Dafny, Chalice, and Spec#. For a
    sample verifier for a toy language built on top of Boogie, see Forro.
    Boogie is also the name of a tool. The tool accepts the Boogie language as
    input, optionally infers some invariants in the given Boogie program, and
    then generates verification conditions that are passed to an SMT solver.
    The default SMT solver is Z3.
