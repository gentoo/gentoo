    Luau is a fast, small, safe, gradually typed embeddable scripting language
    derived from Lua. It is designed to be backwards compatible with Lua 5.1,
    as well as incorporating some features from future Lua releases, but also
    expands the feature set (most notably with type annotations). Luau is
    largely implemented from scratch, with the language runtime being a very
    heavily modified version of Lua 5.1 runtime, with completely rewritten
    interpreter and other performance innovations. The runtime mostly preserves
    Lua 5.1 API, so existing bindings should be more or less compatible with a
    few caveats.
