  <longdescription>
    ELPI implements a variant of Î»Prolog enriched with Constraint Handling
    Rules, a programming language well suited to manipulate syntax trees with
    binders. ELPI is designed to be embedded into larger applications written
    in OCaml as an extension language. It comes with an API to drive the
    interpreter and with an FFI for defining built-in predicates and data
    types, as well as quotations and similar goodies that are handy to adapt
    the language to the host application.
