	# ngx_devel_kit (NDK) is designed in a modular way. As such, only the
	# required modules are built based if the corresponding preprocessor macros
	# are defined.
	#
	# Since we do not want to deal with a dependency hell (other NGINX plugins
	# depend on dfferent NDK's modules) and a bunch of USE flag toggles, NDK is
	# compiled with all its modules. Fortunately, even with all the modules
	# built-in, the resulting binary is really small, so the size is not an
	# issue.
	#
	# For details, have a look at 'objs/ndk_config.c' in NDK's source tree and
	# the 'modular' section in 'README.md'.
