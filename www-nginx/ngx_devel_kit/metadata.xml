		The NDK is an NGINX module that is designed to extend the core functionality of the
		excellent NGINX webserver in a way that can be used as a basis of other NGINX modules.

		It has functions and macros to deal with generic tasks that don't currently have generic
		code as part of the core distribution. The NDK itself adds few features that are seen from a
		user's point of view - it's just designed to help reduce the code that NGINX module
		developers need to write.
