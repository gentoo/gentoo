  vov (Vov's Obsessive Von-Neumann) is a tool that emulates the behavior of a Von-Neumann machine.
  It is basically an interpreter, which reads files in the form of memory assignments and executes
  the encoded instructions. The vov's instructions make you able to perform simple arithmetic data
  manipulation. It is a very useful tool to see if your programs work and how.
