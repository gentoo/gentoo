Wine is an Open Source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.

Think of Wine as a compatibility layer for running Windows programs. Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely free alternative implementation of the Windows API consisting of 100% non-Microsoft code, however Wine can optionally use native Windows DLLs if they are available. Wine provides both a development toolkit for porting Windows source code to Unix as well as a program loader, allowing many unmodified Windows programs to run on x86-based Unixes, including Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris.

This variant of the Wine packaging includes the Wine-Staging patchset.

			Use <pkg>sys-devel/crossdev</pkg> for the toolchain rather than
			<pkg>dev-util/mingw64-toolchain</pkg> (requires manual setting up
			and is mostly unsupported, try disabling if have issues)
		</flag>
		<flag name="dos">Pull in <pkg>games-emulation/dosbox</pkg> to run DOS applications</flag>
		<flag name="gecko">Enable mshtml support using <pkg>app-emulation/wine-gecko</pkg></flag>
		<flag name="mingw">Build PE files using <pkg>dev-util/mingw64-toolchain</pkg> (more tested) rather than <pkg>llvm-core/clang</pkg> (newer)</flag>

		<flag name="wow64">
			Enable the "new" wow64 mode that allows running 32bit
			applications without 32bit ELF multilib by mapping to
			64bit calls (experimental, *may* have worse/unusable
			OpenGL performance or other issues compared to
			USE=abi_x86_32 aka "old" wow64, also lacks 16bit
			support) -- if USE=mingw is set, still need the default
			abi_x86_32 set on <pkg>dev-util/mingw64-toolchain</pkg>
			but that can be done even with /no-multilib/ profiles.

			This can also be enabled on arm64 to allow running
			x86 applications via binary translation.
