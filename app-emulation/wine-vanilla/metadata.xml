Wine is an Open Source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.

Think of Wine as a compatibility layer for running Windows programs. Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely free alternative implementation of the Windows API consisting of 100% non-Microsoft code, however Wine can optionally use native Windows DLLs if they are available. Wine provides both a development toolkit for porting Windows source code to Unix as well as a program loader, allowing many unmodified Windows programs to run on x86-based Unixes, including Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris.

This variant of the Wine packaging does not include external patchsets

		<flag name="wow64">
			Enable the "new" wow64 mode that allows running 32bit
			applications without 32bit ELF multilib by mapping to
			64bit calls. Generally works well with wine-11.0 or
			newer, but may or may not have a small perforamce
			impact or other issues. If USE=mingw is set, still need
			the default abi_x86_32 set on
			<pkg>dev-util/mingw64-toolchain</pkg> but that can be
			done even with /no-multilib/ profiles.

			This can also be enabled on arm64 to allow running x86
			applications via binary translation.
