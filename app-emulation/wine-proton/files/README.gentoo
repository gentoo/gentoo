While this version of Wine is usable independently, it does contain some
Steam-oriented changes that may be unexpected. Notably C:\users\steamuser
is used rather than C:\users\<user-name> and it may be necessary to move
files if converting from non-proton Wine prefixes (like games' save files).

To keep a low maintenance cost, these changes are not reverted in Gentoo
with the exception of re-enabling winemenubuilder for desktop entries.

Also, given this Wine variant is oriented toward running games, some
normally unrelated features (e.g. ldap) may not have real upstream
(Valve) support. Because of this, some are left always disabled.

If needed, use other variants for the more expected Wine behavior.

Given Proton is not creating the Wine prefixes, some features are not
enabled by default and PROTON_* variables to control them are unrecognized.

To (optionally) setup some notable defaults of Proton:
- export WINEFSYNC=1
.    Often improves performance for CPU-bound applications, recommended
.    but should be left disabled if get crashes mentioning fsync errors.
.   >Requires linux kernel >=5.16 if unpatched.
- export WINE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE=1
.    Allows 32bit applications to access more memory, notably helps
.    prevent crashes on memory-heavy applications while using dxvk below.
- WINEPREFIX=/path/to setup_dxvk.sh install --symlink
.    Vulkan-based d3d9/10/11 that often provides both better performance
.    and compatibility (strongly recommended).
.   >Requires app-emulation/dxvk
- WINEPREFIX=/path/to setup_vkd3d_proton.sh install --symlink
.    Like above, but for d3d12. Wine also supports vkd3d as-is but this
.    is the modified fork used by Proton (may or may not be better).
.   >Requires app-emulation/vkd3d-proton

For some applications it may be better to disable these or do other
workarounds, see https://www.protondb.com/ for specific information.

Many other proton-specific improvements / fixes are always enabled, and
some game-specific quirks are auto-enabled as needed (can see a few from
running winecfg).

If have audio/video playback issues, note to look at GStreamer plugins.
Notably USE=ffmpeg on media-plugins/gst-plugins-meta which Proton normally
provide by default.

If have other Wine variants installed, remember to either use `eselect wine`
to select this variant or call it as wine-proton.
