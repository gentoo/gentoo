Since version 1.4.1 upstream has used setuptools-scm to determine the
current version number. Unfortunately the package in question does not
support GitHub release archives, using GitHub VCS snapshots would require
retrieving and updating commit hashes corresponding to release tags, and
PyPI tarballs do not contain tests. setuptools_scm_git_archive does not
help because it requires extra files to be included in the repository,
which upstream has not done.

Seeing as we already know the version number, bypass setuptools_scm
altogether and create the version file ourselves. For obvious reasons the
latter has to be done in ebuilds themselves.
