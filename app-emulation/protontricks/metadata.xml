		A simple wrapper script that allows you to easily run Winetricks commands for Steam Play/Proton
		games. This is often useful when a game requires closed-source runtime libraries that are not
		included with Proton, or to activate Gallium Nine (native Direct3D 9 support) for a Proton game,
		without all the tedious messing around with Wine prefixes.
