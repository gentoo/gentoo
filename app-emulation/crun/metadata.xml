		While most of the tools used in the Linux containers ecosystem are written in
		Go, crun authors believe C is a better fit for a lower level tool like a
		container runtime. runc; the most used implementation of the OCI runtime specs
		written in Go, re-execs itself and use a module written in C for setting up
		the environment before the container process starts.

		crun aims to be also usable as a library that can be easily included in
		programs without requiring an external process for managing OCI containers.
