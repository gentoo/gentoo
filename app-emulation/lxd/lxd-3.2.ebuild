# LXD tarball is packaged with a nice "dist" folder containing all dependencies
# that were vendored by upstream at release time. That saves us the trouble of
# vendoring the dependencies ourselves. This is why there was this drastic drop
# in ebuild complexity compared to pre 3.0.0-r2 ebuilds.

	#
	# ABOUT "-tags libsqlite3": we used to link to the system's sqlite3 library
	# but since v3.0.0, LXD depends on github.com/CanonicalLtd/dqlite which
	# at the time of this writing, depends on patched version of sqlite with
	# replication capabilities added. We don't have that patch in dev-db/sqlite.
	# Therefore, we let LXD use its own private copy of sqlite.
