Subject: [PATCH] vsh: Don't init history in cmdComplete()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Recent rework of virshtest uncovered a subtle bug that was
dormant in now vsh but before that even in monolithic virsh.

In vsh.c there's this vshReadlineInit() function that's supposed
to initialize readline library, i.e. set those global rl_*
pointers.  But it also initializes history library. Then, when
virsh/virt-admin quits, vshReadlineDeinit() is called which
writes history into a file (ensuring the parent directory
exists). So far no problem.

Problem arises when cmdComplete() is called (from a bash
completer, for instance). It does not guard call to
vshReadlineInit() with check for interactive shell (and it should
not), but it sets ctl->historyfile which signals to
vshReadlineDeinit() the history should be written.

Now, no real history is written, because nothing was entered on
the stdin, but the parent directory is created nevertheless. With
recent movement in virshtest.c this means some test cases might
create virsh history file which breaks our promise of not
touching user's data in test suite.
