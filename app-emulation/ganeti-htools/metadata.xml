	These are some simple cluster tools for fixing common allocation
	problems on Ganeti 2.0 clusters.

	Note that these tools are most useful for bigger cluster sizes
	(e.g. more than five or ten machines); at lower sizes, the computations
	they do can also be done manually.

	Most of the tools revolve around the concept of keeping the cluster N+1
	compliant: this means that in case of failure of any node, the instances
	affected can be failed over (via ``gnt-node failover`` or ``gnt-instance
	failover``) to their secondary node, and there is enough memory reserved
	for this operation without needing to shutdown other instances or
	rebalance the cluster.
