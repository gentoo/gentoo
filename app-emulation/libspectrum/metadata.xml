libspectrum is a library designed to make the input and output of some ZX
Spectrum emulator files slightly easier. It is intended to be usable on Unix
variants, Win32 and Mac OS X. Currently, it is mainly (only?) used by Fuse,
but other Spectrum emulator and utility authors are encouraged to use it.
