  xtrs is a Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I/III/4/4P emulator for Unix and the
  X Window System. It includes lower case, the real time clock, hi-res
  graphics, serial port, parallel printer, mouse, cassette, sound and music
  output, 5" and 8" floppy disk drives in single and double density, and
  even hard disk drives. The emulated floppy and hard disk file formats
  are compatible with the popular MSDOS-based emulators by Jeff Vavasour,
  Matthew Reed, and David Keil, and (if you choose a capable enough file
  format), all features of the original TRS-80 floppy disk controller are
  emulated. Under Linux, physical floppy disk drives are also supported.
  Physical cassettes can be read and written too. The user interface is a
  bit spartan, but it gets the job done.
