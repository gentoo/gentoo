Use this command to enable the snapd service:

	systemctl enable snapd.socket

You can source /etc/profile.d/snapd.sh in your shell in order to
update PATH and XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variables to include
installed snaps.

Once you have snapd running (first refer to the *AppArmor Section*
below if you have that enabled), see the snap-store installation
instructions here:

	https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snap-store-app

If snap-store does not work correctly then it may be due to a temporary
service outage which will hopefully be reported on this page:

	https://status.snapcraft.io/

When snap-store is not working due to a service outage, it may still
be possible to install apps via the snap cli. See snap --help for
details. Many apps can be installed without a snap store (Ubuntu One)
account. The snap login, logout, and whoami subcommands are available
to manage snap store account details.

Note that you will need a polkit authentication agent running in
order to authenticate as root when installing snaps as a non-root user.
The agent is typically started by a desktop entry found in
/etc/xdg/autostart such as one of these:

	polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1.desktop
	polkit-kde-authentication-agent-1.desktop

*AppArmor Section*

When apparmor is enabled you should enable these services:

	systemctl enable apparmor.service snapd.apparmor.service

You also need it enabled in your kernel and you may need to add these
kernel parameters to your boot loader configuration:

	apparmor=1 security=apparmor
