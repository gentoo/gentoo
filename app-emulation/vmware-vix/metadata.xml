		The VIX API allows you to write programs and scripts that automate
		virtual machine operations, as well as the guests within virtual
		machines. This API is high-level, easy to use, and practical for both
		script writers and application programmers. It runs on both Windows and
		Linux and supports management of VMware Server, Workstation, and Virtual
		Infrastructure (both ESX and vCenter). Bindings are provided for C,
		Perl, and COM (Visual Basic, VBscript, C#).
