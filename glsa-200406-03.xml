  <description>
    <p>
    Multiple format string vulnerabilities and a heap overflow vulnerability
    were discovered in the code of the neon library (GLSA 200405-01 and
    200405-13). Current versions of the sitecopy package include their own
    version of this library.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    When connected to a malicious WebDAV server, these vulnerabilities could
    allow execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the user running
    sitecopy.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
    upgrade to the latest available version of sitecopy.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All sitecopy users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv "&gt;=net-misc/sitecopy-0.13.4-r2"
    # emerge "&gt;=net-misc/sitecopy-0.13.4-r2"</code>
  </resolution>
