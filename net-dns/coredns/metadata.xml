     CoreDNS is a DNS server/forwarder, written in Go, that chains plugins.
     It is fast and flexible. The key word here is flexible:
     with CoreDNS you are able to do what you want with your DNS data by utilizing plugins.
     CoreDNS can listen for DNS requests coming in over UDP/TCP (go'old DNS), TLS (RFC 7858),
     also called DoT, DNS over HTTP/2 - DoH - (RFC 8484) and gRPC (not a standard).
