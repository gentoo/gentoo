    SheerDNS was written to be a simple replacement master DNS server that can
    be used where atomic updates are required. Because it stores each record in
    a small file, updating records does not require the sheerdns process to be
    notified or restarted. Each update is immediately available and served 
    as-is. 
    SheerDNS is extremely light-weight, simple, and fast, and written with 
    security in mind.
