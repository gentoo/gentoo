# A whitespace-separated list of addresses on which to listen. The
# syntax is "host/port", where the port defaults to 53.
#
# Note that by default the rbldnsd init script does not require any
# interfaces other than lo to be "up" (see bug #439092). So if you
# LISTEN on a non-loopback interface, you should specify a dependency
# on that interface using rc_need. An example is given below assuming
# that net.lan0 provides 192.168.0.1.
#
# rc_need="net.lan0"
#
# LISTEN="127.0.0.1
#         192.168.0.1/5353"
#
LISTEN="localhost"


# A whitespace-separated list of RBL zones. For the correct syntax, please
# see the rbldnsd(8) man page. The following $ZONES will look for
# files named "badguys.example.com" and "spammers.example.net" (in the
# appropriate format) under /var/db/rbldnsd, and use those same names
# for the blacklists contained therein.
ZONES="badguys.example.com:ip4set:badguys.example.com
       spammers.example.net:ip4tset:spammers.example.net"


# Add any additional options for the rbldnsd daemon below. The -a and
# -vv below are suggested for performance/security reasons. They are
# described in the man page.
#
# The rootdir (-r) and PID (-p) options are passed automatically, with
# rootdir set to /var/db/rbldnsd (where you should put your zone
# files). The daemon will run as the rbldns user, which was created by
# portage.
OPTIONS="-a -vv"
