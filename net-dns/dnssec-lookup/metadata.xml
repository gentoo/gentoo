	Lookup is a simple graphical utility that can be used to query a network for domain name records. 
	The tool understands DNSSEC and color-codes the results based on whether 
	the record has been securely validated (green), is a 'trusted' answer but not validated (yellow), 
	or fails DNSSEC validation (red).
