    Luakit  is  a highly configurable, browser framework based on the WebKit web
    content engine and the GTK+ toolkit. It is very fast, extensible by Lua and
    licensed under the GNU GPLv3 license. It is primarily targeted at power
    users, developers and any people with too much time on their hands who
    want  to  have fine-grained control over their web browsers behaviour and
    interface.
