Subject: [PATCH] Remove nodejs version check

Added in https://github.com/chromium/chromium/commit/0ff8528999941d7182be6fc77aeb12a110a3cd86,
this change is only really useful for gclient checkouts and breaks the
ability for downstreams to provide their own, compatible, nodejs
version via the system package manager (or for use on arches other than
those that Google provides binaries for):

[ERR_ASSERTION]: Failed NodeJS version check: Expected version 'v22.11.0', but found 'v22.13.1'. Did you run 'gclient sync'

This is google development footgun protection, working around
poor development practices and gclient's inability to ensure
that the source tree is in a consistent state. We don't need it
here.
