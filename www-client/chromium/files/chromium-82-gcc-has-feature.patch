Subject: [PATCH] GCC: do not use __has_feature in UnsanitizedAtomic

GCC fails to build as unsanitized_atomic.cc is using a Clang only
compiler macro: __has_feature:

  ../../third_party/blink/renderer/platform/heap/unsanitized_atomic.cc:9:18: error: missing binary operator before token "("
      9 | #if __has_feature(address_sanitizer)
        |                  ^
