ck4up is a small command-line utility, writen in ruby, to watch http and ftp 
sites for updates. ck4up scans through a configuration file, fetches the 
listed URLs from the web, computes the md5sum of the page, and compares the 
value with one stored in a gdbm database. If both differ a message will be 
written to the standard output.

To improve performance, ck4up is multi-threaded. Regular expressions can be
applied to each page in the event that ck4up produces repetitive diff
messages. For example, if daily snapshots and a web counter are on the same
page. To simplify maintenance of the configuration file, a kind of
macro-expansion can be used.
