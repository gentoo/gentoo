		Surfraw provides a fast unix command line interface to a variety of
		popular WWW search engines and other artifacts of power. It reclaims
		google, altavista, babelfish, dejanews, freshmeat, research index,
		slashdot and many others from the false-prophet, pox-infested heathen
		lands of html-forms, placing these 	wonders where they belong, deep in
		unix heartland, as god loving extensions to the shell.

		Surfraw abstracts the browser away from input. Doing so lets it get on
		with what it's good at. Browsing. Interpretation of linguistic forms is
		handed back to the	shell, which is what it, and human beings are good
		at. Combined with netscape-remote or incremental text browsers, such as
		links (http://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~mikulas/links/),
		w3m (http://www.w3m.org/), and screen(1) a Surfraw liberateur is
		capable of navigating speeds that leave GUI tainted idolaters agape
		with fear and wonder.
