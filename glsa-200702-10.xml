  <synopsis>
    Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the network components of
    UFO2000 that could result in the remote execution of arbitrary code.

    <p>
    Five vulnerabilities were found: a buffer overflow in recv_add_unit();
    a problem with improperly trusting user-supplied string information in
    decode_stringmap(); several issues with array manipulation via various
    commands during play; an SQL injection in server_protocol.cpp; and
    finally, a second buffer overflow in recv_map_data().
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    An attacker could send crafted network traffic as part of a
    multi-player game that could result in remote code execution on the
    remote opponent or the server. A remote attacker could also run
    arbitrary SQL queries against the server account database, and perform
    a Denial of Service on a remote opponent by causing the game to crash.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    UFO2000 currently depends on the dumb-0.9.2 library, which has been
    removed from portage due to security problems (GLSA 200608-14) .
    Because of this, UFO2000 has been masked, and we recommend unmerging
    the package until the next beta release can remove the dependency on
    dumb.
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --ask --verbose --unmerge ufo2000</code>
