		afew is an initial tagging script for Notmuch.  Its basic task is to
		provide automatic tagging each time new mail is registered with Notmuch.

		In addition to more elementary features such as adding tags based on
		e-mail headers or maildir folders, handling killed threads and spam, it
		can do some heavy magic in order to learn how to initially tag your
		mails based on their content.

		In move mode, afew will move mails between maildir folders according to
		configurable rules that can contain arbitrary notmuch queries to match
		against any searchable attributes.
