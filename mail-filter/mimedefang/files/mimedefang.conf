# The multiplexor does not start all slaves at the same time.  Instead,

# (If the system is busy, the multiplexor starts slaves as incoming mail
# requires attention.)
# MX_SLAVE_DELAY=3

# The next setting is an absolute limit on slave activation.  The multiplexor
# will NEVER activate a slave within MX_MIN_SLAVE_DELAY seconds of another.
# The default of zero means that the multiplexor will activate slaves as
# quickly as necessary to keep up with incoming mail.
