# The multiplexor does not start all workers at the same time. Instead,
# it starts one worker every X seconds when the system is idle.
# If the system is busy, the multiplexor starts workers as incoming mail
# requires attention.
# MX_OPTS+=' -w 3'

# The next setting is an absolute limit on worker activation.  The multiplexor
# will NEVER activate a worker within X seconds of another.
# The default of zero means that the multiplexor will activate workers as
# quickly as necessary to keep up with incoming mail.

# Maximum number of processes to run (mail received while this many
# processes are running is rejected with a temporary failure, so be
# wary of how many emails you receive at a time).  This applies only
# if you DO use the multiplexor.  The default value of 2 is probably
# too low; we suggest 10 instead.

# Uncomment to log worker status; it will be logged every X seconds.
