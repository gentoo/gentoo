# This is the configuration file that /etc/init.d/spampd sources when
# started.

# SPAMPD_OPTS defines the command-line arguments to be passed to the
# spampd daemon upon start-up.  A complete list of options can be
# found in the documentation, or by issuing the command
# "/usr/sbin/spampd --help"

SPAMPD_OPTS="--host=localhost:10025 --relayhost=localhost:10026 --tagall"

# Note: (from the Installation section in the spampd documentation)
# "Note that spampd replaces spamd from the SpamAssassin distribution
# in function. You do not need to run spamd in order for spampd to
# work. This has apparently been the source of some confusion, so now
# you know."
