	libsrs2 is the next generation SRS library from the original designer of
	SRS. It implements the Sender Rewriting Scheme, a part of the SPF/SRS
	protocol pair. Libsrs2 has been written from an entirely clean codebase with
	compliance, speed and versatility in mind. It is platform independent and
	has no external dependencies. It is thread-safe and heap-safe, and is
	suitable for large scale applications and embedded systems and can operate
	without many standard system facilities.
