# The built-in ipaddress module handles the parsing of IP addresses. If
# python is built without ipv6 support, then ipaddress can't parse ipv6
# addresses, and the daemon will crash if it sees an ipv6 SPF record. In
# other words, it's completely broken.

	#   * The configuration file is hard-coded to /usr/local.
	#   * The paths in the systemd service file are hard-coded to /usr/local.
	#   * We need to write an OpenRC service script for it.

	# These are all eventually doable, but I'm not willing to commit to
	# making the milter work before upstream is.
