<longdescription lang="en">
A spamassassin that performs DNS validations on the first untrusted relay
looking for signs of a Botnet infected host, such as no reverse DNS, a
hostname that would indicate an ISP client or domain workstation, or other
hosts that aren't intended to be acting as a direct mail submitter outside of
their own domain.
