		Apcupsd can be used for power mangement and controlling most of
		APC's UPS models on Unix and Windows machines. Apcupsd works with
		most of APC's Smart-UPS models as well as most simple signalling
		models such a Back-UPS, and BackUPS-Office. During a power failure,
		apcupsd will inform the users about the power failure and that a
		shutdown may occur. If power is not restored, a system shutdown
		will follow when the battery is exhausted, a timeout (seconds)
		expires, or runtime expires based on internal APC calculations
		determined by power consumption rates.
