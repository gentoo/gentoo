Apcupsd can be used for power mangement and controlling most of 
APC's UPS models on Unix and Windows machines. Apcupsd works with 
most of APC's Smart-UPS models as well as most simple signalling 
models such a Back-UPS, and BackUPS-Office. During a power failure, 
apcupsd will inform the users about the power failure and that a 
shutdown may occur. If power is not restored, a system shutdown 
will follow when the battery is exhausted, a timeout (seconds) 
expires, or runtime expires based on internal APC calculations 
determined by power consumption rates.
