    <p>
    In some situations the login program could leak sensitive data due to an
    incorrect usage of a reallocated pointer.
    </p>
    <p>
	<b>NOTE:</b> Only users who have PAM support <b>disabled</b> on their
	systems (i.e.  <i>-PAM</i> in their USE variable) will be affected by this
	vulnerability.  By default, this USE flag is <b>enabled</b> on all
	architectures.  Users with PAM support on their system receive login binaries
	as part of the pam-login package, which remains unaffected.
