  Astronomers often need to relate positions on an image of the sky to
  positions on the real sky to identify catalogued objects in images,
  tell other people where to look to find an identified object, or to
  compute motions of planets, satellites, asteroids, or comets. WCSTools
  is a package of programs and a library of utility subroutines for
  setting and using the world coordinate systems (WCS) in the headers of
  the most common astronomical image formats, FITS and IRAF .imh, to
  relate image pixels to sky coordinates.
  The Gentoo package is using GNU autotools to produce portable shared
  and static libraried.
