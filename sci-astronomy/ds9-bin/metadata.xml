		The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Image Deep Space 9 is an
		astronomical imaging and data visualization application. It is the
		new generation of the SAOImage software. DS9 supports FITS images
		and binary tables, multiple frame buffers, region manipulation, many
		scale algorithms and colormaps. It provides communication with
		external analysis tasks and is configurable and extensible. DS9
		supports multiple frame buffers, mosaic images, tiling, blinking,
		geometric markers, colormap manipulation, scaling, arbitrary zoom,
		rotation, pan, and a variety of coordinate systems. DS9 also
		supports FTP and HTTP data access.
		This is the binary version (source version has a lot of source
		bundling issues).
