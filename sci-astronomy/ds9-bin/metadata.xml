  The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Image Deep Space 9 is an
  astronomical imaging and data visualization application. It is the
  new generation of the SAOImage software. DS9 supports FITS images
  and binary tables, multiple frame buffers, region manipulation, many
  scale algorithms and colormaps. It provides communication with
  external analysis tasks and is configurable and extensible. DS9
  supports multiple frame buffers, mosaic images, tiling, blinking,
  geometric markers, colormap manipulation, scaling, arbitrary zoom,
  rotation, pan, and a variety of coordinate systems. DS9 also
  supports FTP and HTTP data access.
  This is the binary version (source version has a lot of source
  bundling issues).
