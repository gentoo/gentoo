  ATmospheric Modeling for ALMA is a library of routines for modelling
  transmission of cm/mm/sub-mm wavelength radiation through the Earths
  atmosphere. It is designed to simulate both the absorption/emission
  of radiation and the dispersion (i.e., the frequency dependent
  refractive index of the atmosphere).
