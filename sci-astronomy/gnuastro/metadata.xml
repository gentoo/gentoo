    The GNU Astronomy Utilities (Gnuastro) is an official GNU package
    consisting of various programs and library functions for the
    manipulation and analysis of astronomical data. All the programs
    share the same basic command-line user interface for the comfort
    of both the users and developers. Gnuastro is written to comply
    fully with the GNU coding standards so it integrates finely with
    the GNU/Linux operating system. This also enables astronomers to
    expect a fully familiar experience in the source code, building,
    installing and command-line user interaction that they have seen
    in all the other GNU software that they use.
