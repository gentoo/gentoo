  Celestia is a real-time space simulation that lets you experience
  our universe in three dimensions. You can travel throughout the solar
  system, to any of over 100,000 stars, or beyond the galaxy. All
  travel in Celestia is seamless; the exponential zoom feature lets you
  explore space across a range of scales, from galaxy clusters down
  to spacecraft a few meters across. A 'point-and-goto' interface
  is used to navigate through the universe to the object you
  want to visit.
