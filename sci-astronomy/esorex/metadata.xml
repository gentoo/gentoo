		EsoRex is the ESO Recipe Execution Tool. It can list, configure and
		execute CPL-based recipes from the command line. One of the features
		provided by the CPL is the ability to create data-reduction algorithms
		that run as plugins (dynamic libraries). These are called recipes and
		are one of the main aspects of the CPL data-reduction development
		environment. As these recipes are dynamic libraries, it is not
		possible to run them directly from the command line. However, ESO
		provides several tools to do this, thus saving recipe developers the
		need to write such an application themselves. One of these is GASGANO
		(a GUI-based tool) and the other is EsoRex (which runs from the
		command line.
