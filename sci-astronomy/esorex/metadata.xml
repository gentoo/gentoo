  EsoRex is the ESO Recipe Execution Tool. It can list, configure and
  execute CPL-based recipes from the command line. One of the features
  provided by the CPL is the ability to create data-reduction algorithms
  that run as plugins (dynamic libraries). These are called recipes and
  are one of the main aspects of the CPL data-reduction development
  environment. As these recipes are dynamic libraries, it is not
  possible to run them directly from the command line. However, ESO
  provides several tools to do this, thus saving recipe developers the
  need to write such an application themselves. One of these is GASGANO
  (a GUI-based tool) and the other is EsoRex (which runs from the
  command line.
