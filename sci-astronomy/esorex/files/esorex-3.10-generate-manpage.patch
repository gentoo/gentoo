+[NAME]
+esorex \- ESO Recipe Execution Tool
+
+[DESCRIPTION]
+EsoRex is the ESO Recipe Execution Tool. It can list, configure and execute
+CPL-based recipes from the command line. 
+
+One of the features provided by the CPL is the ability to create
+data-reduction algorithms that run as plugins (dynamic libraries). These are
+called recipes and are one of the main aspects of the CPL data-reduction
+development environment.
+
+As these recipes are dynamic libraries, it is not possible to run them
+directly from the command line. However, ESO provides several tools to do
+this, thus saving recipe developers the need to write such an application
+themselves. One of these is GASGANO (a GUI-based tool) and the other is 
+ EsoRex (which runs from the command line) and is described here.  
+
+[ENVIRONMENT]
+All options can be set as environment parameters as well. See the previous
+paragraph for details.
+
+[HINTS]
+.TP
+.SH File permissions
+When a recipe is used with the \fB\-\-suppress\-prefix\fR option, and the 
+\fB\-\-output\-dir\fR is set to the current working directory, then the first
+execution of a recipe will work correctly, but subsequent executions may 
+fail. This is due to output products being given \`read-only\' permission 
+(to avoid the potential inadvertant loss of products). The recipe itself 
+is unable to modify the permissions, and thus it fails when attempting to 
+create the file. The solution (other than using a different output directory
+or prefixes) is to change the permission of these output files or delete 
+them prior to any subsequent execution of that recipe. 
+
+This problem is less likely to occur in EsoRex v2+, due to the replacement of
+the \fB\-\-output\-overwrite\fR option with the \fB\-\-output\-readonly\fR 
+(which is disabled by default). However, a determined user can still reach 
+this situation, in which case the non-readable products must have their 
+permissions changed, as described above.
+
+.TP
+.SH Configuration files
+When creating configuration files, if the the recipe is provided on the
+command line, then EsoRex will generate the configuration file for this
+recipe. If no recipe name is given, then EsoRex will generate a configuration
+file for EsoRex itself. All configuration files are written in the
+$HOME/.esorex/ directory.
+
+.TP
+.SH Memory checking
+It is possible to get EsoRex to check for memory leaks in the recipe
+that it is running, by enabling the \fB\-\-mem\-check\fR option. Then, at the
+conclusion of the recipe execution, and after memory deallocation, a list of
+all remaining allocated memory will be printed to screen. If there are no
+memory leaks, then no addition output is displayed.
+
+[FILES]
+.TP
+.SH /etc/esorex.rc $HOME/.esorex/esorex.rc
+Default configuration files
+
+The configuration file contains the EsoRex options, less the \`\-\-\'
+switch, but prefixed with \`esorex.caller.\'. Blank lines are ignored and
+lines beginning with \`#\' are treated as comments.
+
+Here is an example configuration file.
+
+ # Example EsoRex configuration file
+ #
+ esorex.caller.recipe-dir=/home/username/EsoRex/Plugins
+ esorex.caller.log-dir=.
+ esorex.caller.log-file=esorex.log
+ esorex.caller.log-file=esorex.log
+ esorex.caller.output-dir=.
+ esorex.caller.output-prefix=out_
+
+.TP
+.SH filename.sof
+A sof file contains a list of the input data. This data is specified in an sof
+file (which is just a text file), where each input file is specified with its
+associated classification and category. The format of each line in the sof
+file is as follows:
+
+ full-path-to-file  classification
+
+Optionally, a third column may be provided. Permitted values are either RAW or
+CALIB. This is for when a recipe does not identify the type of input file, but
+as all ESO recipes are required to do so, this column is typically not needed.
+
+An example sof file, for the mythological "ZIMOS" instrument, might look like this:
+
+ /data/mos/ZIMOS.03-12-26T01:05:06.fits  MOS_SCIENCE
+ /data/mos/ZIMOS.03-12-26T01:26:00.fits  MOS_SCIENCE
+ /data/mos/ZIMOS.03-12-26T01:47:04.fits  MOS_SCIENCE
+ /data/cal/master_bias4.fits             MASTER_BIAS
+ /data/cal/grs_LR_red.3.tfits            GRISM_TABLE
+ /data/gasgano/extract_table2.fits       EXTRACT_TABLE
+ /data/cal/badpixel.3.tfits              CCD_TABLE
+
+For an concrete example for a specific instrument, check the documentation for that
+instrument.
