  The IDL Astronomy Users Library is a central repository for
  low-level astronomy software written in the commercial language
  IDL or GNU version of it (GDL). The Library is not meant to be an
  integrated package, but rather is a collection of procedures from
  which users can pick and choose (and possibly modify) for their own
  use. Submitted procedures are given a cursory testing, but are
  basically stored in the Library as submitted.
