  Gasgano is a Data File Organiser developed and maintained by ESO to
  help its user community to manage and organise in a systematic way the
  astronomical data observed and produced by all VLT compliant
  telescopes, i.e. by telescopes which are being operated through
  Observation Blocks. The tool also supports FITS files which are not
  generated by those telescopes but with a limited number of
  functionalities.
