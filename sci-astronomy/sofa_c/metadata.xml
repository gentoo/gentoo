 This is a suite of vector/matrix routines and various utilities that
 underpin the astronomy algorithms, which include routines for the
 following:
  * Calendars
  * Time Scales
  * Earth rotation and sidereal time
  * Ephemerides (medium precision)
  * Geocentric/geodetic transformations
  * Precession, nutation, polar motion
  * Star space motion
  * Star catalogue conversion
 This is the ANSI C version of the library.
 The International Astronomical Union's SOFA service has the task of
 establishing and maintaining an accessible and authoritative set of
 algorithms and procedures that implement standard models used in
 fundamental astronomy.
