    Enable debugging as encouraged by upstream: [The default
    configuration] includes --enable-debug (by default), which
    contains many assertions.  Obviously, these "waste" space,
    but in the past, they have caught potentially dangerous bugs
    before they would have done damage, so we think it's worth
    it.  Also, it means we get more bug reports ;)
