	Enable device-mapper support from <pkg>sys-fs/lvm2</pkg> in parted

		<flag name="debug">
	Enable debugging as encouraged by upstream: [The default configuration]
	includes --enable-debug (by default), which contains many assertions.
	Obviously, these "waste" space, but in the past, they have caught
	potentially dangerous bugs before they would have done damage, so we think
	it's worth it.  Also, it means we get more bug reports ;)
