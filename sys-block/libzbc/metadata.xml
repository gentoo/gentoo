		libzbc is a simple library providing functions for manipulating disks
		supporting the Zoned Block Command (ZBC) and Zoned-device ATA command
		set (ZAC) disks. libzbc implemention is compliant with the latest
		drafts of the ZBC and ZAC standards defined by INCITS technical
		committee T10 and T13 (respectively).

		In addition to supporting ZBC and ZAC disks, libzbc also implements an
		emulation mode allowing emulating the behavior of a host-managed zoned
		disk using a regular file or a standard block device as backing store.
