	<longdescription>The goal of the Clang project is to create a new C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++ front-end for the LLVM compiler.

Features and Goals

Some of the goals for the project include the following:

End-User Features:
Fast compiles and low memory use
Expressive diagnostics
GCC compatibility
Utility and Applications:

Modular library based architecture
Support diverse clients (refactoring, static analysis, code generation, etc)
Allow tight integration with IDEs
Use the LLVM BSD License
Internal Design and Implementation:

A real-world, production quality compiler
A simple and hackable code base
A single unified parser for C, Objective C, C++, and Objective C++
Conformance with C/C++/ObjC and their variants</longdescription>
