  The FOX Calculator is a simple desktop calculator geared toward the
  programmer for the FOX Toolkit. It supports not only a full
  complement scientific functions, but also common operations that
  programmers need, such as bitwise operations, bitwise shifting, and
  base-2 logarithm and exponents, and numeric conversion between
  hexadecimal, octal, binary, and decimal. The FOX Calculator
  implements correct operator precedences, so expressions like 2+3*5
  yield the correct result, which is 17, and not 25. Also featured is
  a constant memory, which permanently stores its value even if you
  exit the calculator and restart it later.
