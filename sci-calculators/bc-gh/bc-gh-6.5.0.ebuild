		# GNU bc. If there is no GNU bc installed, then those tests should be
		# skipped. That's what this option does. Without it, we would have a
		# dependency cycle. Those tests are super long, anyway.
		-G
		# Disables the automatic stripping of binaries.

		# to not trigger the OOM killer because malloc() lies.

	# messages are passed to printf(); they have format specifiers. With these
	# env vars, the internal error messages are used, instead of the installed
	# locales, which might be different since the new locale files are not
	# installed yet. (It is impossible to use uninstalled locales because of the
	# poor design of POSIX locales.)
