    Transcalc is an analysis and synthesis tool for calculating the
    electrical and physical properties of different kinds of RF and
    microwave transmission lines. Transcalc was somewhat inspired by the
    functionality of Agilent Technologies' commercial program linecalc.
    Transcalc aspires to be more functional in the long run and
    well-documented with appropriate references to formulas that are used.
    Transcalc is built using the GIMP toolkit (GTK) for its GUI interface.
    For each type of transmission line, using dialog boxes, you can enter
    values for the various parameters, and either calculate its electrical
    properties (analyze), or use the given electrical requirements to
    sythesize physical parameters of the required transmission line.
    Available transmission lines (this list will expand with subsequent
    releases): microstrip, rectangular waveguide, coaxial line, coupled
    microstrip.
