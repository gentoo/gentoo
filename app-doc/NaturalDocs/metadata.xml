		Natural Docs is an open-source, extensible, multi-language
		documentation generator. It extracts specially formatted comments
		from source code and builds HTML documentation from it. The syntax
		is transparent so that the comments in the source code read just as
		easily as the generated documentation. It also focuses on automation
		and high-quality generated output.
