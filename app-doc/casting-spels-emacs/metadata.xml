  Ever wonder what makes Lisp so powerful? Now you can find out for yourself -
  And you can do it right inside your GNU Emacs text editor! If you've spent
  any time working with Emacs, you'll find out that in order to get the full
  power out of this uber text editor, you'll want to learn a little about
  programming in Emacs Lisp. Anyone who has ever learned to program in Lisp
  will tell you it is very different from any other programming language.
  It is different in lots of surprising ways - This comic book will let you
  find out how Lisp's unique design makes it so powerful!
