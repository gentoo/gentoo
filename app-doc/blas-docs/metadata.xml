BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines) is a set of efficient routines
for most of the basic vector and matrix operations. They are widely
used as the basis for other high quality linear algebra software, for
example lapack and linpack. This implementation is the Fortran 77
reference implementation found at netlib.
This package contains manual pages for the routines, and other
quick reference in postscript format.
