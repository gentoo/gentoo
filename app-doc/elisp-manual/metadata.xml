  Most of the GNU Emacs text editor is written in the programming language
  called Emacs Lisp. You can write new code in Emacs Lisp and install it as an
  extension to the editor. However, Emacs Lisp is more than a mere "extension
  language"; it is a full computer programming language in its own right. You
  can use it as you would any other programming language.

  Because Emacs Lisp is designed for use in an editor, it has special features
  for scanning and parsing text as well as features for handling files,
  buffers, displays, subprocesses, and so on. Emacs Lisp is closely integrated
  with the editing facilities; thus, editing commands are functions that can
  also conveniently be called from Lisp programs, and parameters for
  customization are ordinary Lisp variables.

  This manual attempts to be a full description of Emacs Lisp. For a
  beginner's introduction to Emacs Lisp, see An Introduction to Emacs Lisp
  Programming, by Bob Chassell, also published by the Free Software
  Foundation. This manual presumes considerable familiarity with the use of
  Emacs for editing; see The GNU Emacs Manual for this basic information.
