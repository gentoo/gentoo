  <longdescription> The Heirloom Documentation Tools package provides
    troff, nroff, and related utilities to format manual pages and other
    documents for output on terminals and printers. They are portable
    and enhanced versions of the utilities released by Sun as part of
    OpenSolaris. Heirloom-doctools can be used as an alternative to
    the GNU groff package.

      Build the mpm utility; this is disabled by default because it's
      rarely used and the only C++ tool in the suite.
