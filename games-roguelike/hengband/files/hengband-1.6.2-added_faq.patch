+=========  Hengband FAQ  ==========
+
+
+Q. I want to play as an Android, Balrog, Golem, Skeleton, Zombie,
+   Spectre, or Ent.  But I can't find any scroll of satisfy hunger.
+   And Berserkers no longer have racial ability of satisfy hunger.
+   How do I avoid starvation?
+
+A. Scroll of Satisfy Hunger and Berserker's ability of Satisfy Hunger
+   are obsoleted.  And races which previously relyed on Satisfy Hunger
+   have new sources of nutrition now; Android can quaff oil.  Balrogs
+   can sacrifice human corpse using the 'E'at command.  Golems,
+   Skeletons, Zombies, and Spectres can absorb mana from staves and
+   wands using the 'E'at command.  Ents can gain enough nutrition from
+   potions.
+
+
+Q. I got through the Yeek cave and I headed into the wilderness....and
+   I'm still there searching endlessly down one road after another
+   looking for a town.  Where are other towns and dungeons?
+
+A. You need to use the global wilderness map (press the < key on the
+   ground level).  This gives you a larger map of the world, where you
+   can travel to other towns and dungeons.  By the way, you should
+   read the readme_eng.txt and the on-line help.
+
+
+Q. I'm playing as a berserker, and cannot read scrolls.  How do I
+   remove curse?
+
+A. You can simply 't'ake off cursed equipments.  Since cursed
+   equipments are strongly sticking, you need to try 't'ake off
+   command many times.
+
+
+Q. I know Berserkers cannot use scrolls, and rods.  How do I recall
+   from dungeon?  Maybe I need to travel completely on foot?!!
+
+A. Berserkers gain a class power 'Recall' at level 10.  Press the
+   'U'(original keyset) or 'O'(Roguelike keyset) to use class power.
+
+
+Q. Why Ninja have Iron Spikes at the start?
+
+A. Ninja can use Iron Spikes as shuriken; they can throw it as good
+   missile weapon.  Simply use 'v' command.
+
+
+Q. I'm at normal speed (+0). But normal speed monsters sometimes do
+   double or even triple move!
+
+A. On Hengband, amount of energy needed for a move is somewhat
+   randomized.  This method of speed system is an important feature of
+   Hengband, and is simulating real fighting.  So always expect that
+   your enemy can get two or three move.  Don't fight when your HP is
+   low, if you don't want to get instakill!
+
+
+Q. I tried to dual wield two weapons.  But I couldn't hit anything!
+
+A. You need to practice your dual wielding skill(proficiency level)
+   and your weapon skills.  Hitting high level monsters many times
+   will improve your skills.  Note that the information command '~'
+   reveals your proficiency levels.
+
+
+Q. How do skills(proficiency levels) work?
+
+A. Weapon proficiency levels and dual wielding proficiency levels
+   increase your to-hit bonus.  Spell proficiency levels decrease fail
+   rate and mana consumption rate of spells.  Riding proficiency level
+   gives you more speed when you are riding on a high speed monster,
+   and decreases risk of falling from your mount.
+
+
+Q. How do I increase proficiency level?
+
+A. Proficiency level of a weapon will increase when you hit a monster
+   whose level is high enough compared with your character level.
+   Proficiency level of a spell will increase when you cast the spell
+   at the dungeon level deep enough compared with the spell level.
+   Needed condition to increase riding proficiency level is rather
+   complex;  Generally, you need to hit a monster whose level is high
+   enough compared with current riding proficiency level or to shoot a
+   monster when ride on high level mount.
+
+
+Q. How do I ride on a monster?
+
+A. At first, summon, charm or capture some suitable monster. Then use
+   pet menu command 'p'.
+
+
+Q. How to use Capture Ball?
+
+A. Just equip it and activate 'A' to a dying monster.
+
+
+Q. I cannot hold a weapon and a shield without losing control of my
+   horse.  My horse runs aimlessly!
+
+A. You cannot directly control your mount unless you use one hand to
+   control your mount.  But you can command your mount.  Just use 'p'
+   command, and give your mount a target.  The horse which was given a
+   target will no longer run around aimlessly.
+
+
+Q. Where is the score server?  And how do I register my character
+   dumps?
+
+A. Here;'http://hengband.sourceforge.jp/en/score.html'.
+   When you die, Hengband will ask you as 'Do you send score to the
+   world score sever?'.  And if you answer 'y', Hengband will
+   automatically register your character dump and screen shot.
+
+
+Q. Are there spoiler for more details?
+
+A. Yes. Henkma is writing spoiler page for Hengband;
+   'http://www.kmc.gr.jp/~henkma/heng-e/index.html'
+
+
+Q. Who wrote Hengband?
+
+A. Hengband is mainly based on ZAngband 2.2.8 Japanese version.
+   ZAngband 2.2.8 Japanese version was developed by Mitsuhiro Itakura,
+   based on both ZAngband 2.2.8 and Angband 2.8.3 Japanese version,
+   and has some original features, for example, Auto-picker, in
+   addition to simple translation.
+
+   Hengband also includes codes from many other variants including
+   ToME, OAngband, etc...  Mr.Hoge wrote the first original part of
+   Hengband.  And currently, it is maintained by Hengband Development
+   Team including Mr.Hoge, Habu, Henkma, iks, Kuwa, Mogami and nsk.
