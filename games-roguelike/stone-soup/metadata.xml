		Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is a free roguelike game of exploration
		and treasure-hunting in dungeons filled with dangerous and
		unfriendly monsters in a quest for the mystifyingly fabulous Orb
		of Zot.

		Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup has diverse species and many different
		character backgrounds to choose from, deep tactical game-play,
		sophisticated magic, religion and skill systems, and a grand
		variety of monsters to fight and run from, making each game
		unique and challenging.

		Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup can be played offline, or online on a
		public telnet/ssh server thanks to the good folks at
		crawl.akrasiac.org (CAO) and crawl.develz.org (CDO). These public
		servers allow you to meet other playersâ€™ ghosts, watch other people
		playing, and, in general, have a blast!
