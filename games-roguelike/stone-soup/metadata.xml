		Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is a free roguelike game of exploration
		and treasure-hunting in dungeons filled with dangerous and
		unfriendly monsters in a quest for the mystifyingly fabulous Orb
		of Zot.

		Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup has diverse species and many different
		character backgrounds to choose from, deep tactical game-play,
		sophisticated magic, religion and skill systems, and a grand
		variety of monsters to fight and run from, making each game
		unique and challenging.

		Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup can be played offline, or online on a
		public telnet/ssh server thanks to the good folks at
		crawl.akrasiac.org (CAO) and crawl.develz.org (CDO). These public
		servers allow you to meet other players’ ghosts, watch other people
		playing, and, in general, have a blast!
