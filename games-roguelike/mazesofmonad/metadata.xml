		MazesOfMonad is a console-based Role Playing Game. You create
		characters with their strong and weak points, and try to complete
		mazes that are randomly generated. You can pick up gold and items
		on the way, meet monsters, and deal with them as you want. You can
		fight, use magic, bribe, trade, steal... This is only a simple game
		that I did to see what building a full blown Haskell application
		is like to develop. Versions 1.0.5 and above are complete
		and working.
