.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Moria\^
plays a dungeon game with you.
It lets you generate a character,
lets you buy equipment,
and lets you wander in a fathomless dungeon
while finding treasure and being attacked by monsters
and fellow adventurers.
Typing
.B ?
gives you a list of commands.
.PP
The ultimate object of
.I moria
is to kill the Balrog,
which dwells on the 50th level of the
dungeon, 2,500 feet underground.
Most players never even reach the Balrog,
and those that do seldom live to tell about it.
.PP
For a more complete description of the game,
read the document
.I The Dungeons of Moria.
.PP
By default,
.I moria
will save and restore games from a file
called moria.save in your home directory.  If the environment
variable MORIA_SAV is defined, then
.I moria
will use that
file name instead of the default.  If MORIA_SAV is not a complete
path name, then the savefile will be created or restored from the
current directory.  You can also explicitly specify a savefile
on the command line.
.PP
If you use the \fB\-n\fP option,
.I moria
will create a new game,
ignoring any savefile which may already exist.
This works best when a savefile name is specified on the
command line, as this will prevent
.I moria
from trying to overwrite the default savefile
(if it exists) when you try to save your game.
.PP
You move in various directions
by pressing the numeric keypad keys, VMS-style.
If you specify
\fB\-r\fP, you move the same way you do in \fIrogue\fP(6).
You can also specify
\fB\-o\fP to force the VMS-style command set.
These options will override defaults stored in the savefile.  If these
options are given multiple times, only the last one will take effect.
.PP
If you specify
.BR \-s ,
.I moria
prints all of the scores in the score file and exits.
On a multiuser system, if you specify
.BR \-S ,
.I moria
prints prints only those scores belonging to you and then exits.
.PP
If you specify \fB\-w\fP,
.I moria
will start up in wizard mode.
You can resurrect a dead character by using this option when starting
the game.  Resurrected characters are teleported to the town level
and given zero hitpoints.
Wizard mode is intended for debugging the game, and for experimenting
with new features.  Any other use is considered cheating.
Games played with wizard mode are not scored.
