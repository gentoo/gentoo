	The XAR project aims to provide an easily extensible archive format.
    Important design decisions include an easily extensible XML table of
    contents for random access to archived files, storing the toc at the
    beginning of the archive to allow for efficient handling of streamed
    archives, the ability to handle files of arbitrarily large sizes, the
    ability to choose independent encodings for individual files in the
    archive, the ability to store checksums for individual files in both
    compressed and uncompressed form, and the ability to query the table of
    content's rich meta-data.
