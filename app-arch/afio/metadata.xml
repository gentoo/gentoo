Afio makes cpio-format archives. It deals somewhat gracefully
with input data corruption, supports multi-volume archives during interactive
operation, and can make compressed archives that are much safer than compressed
tar or cpio archives. Afio is best used as an 'archive engine' in a backup
script.
