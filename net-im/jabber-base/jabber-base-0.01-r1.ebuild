#Info for people working in jabber related packages

#/etc/jabber/ for configuration files
#/var/run/jabber/ for the pid files
#/var/spool/jabber/ for the flat files databases (actually there must be a ewarn
#at end of ebuild telling user to creat /var/spool/jabber/JID, as some transports fail to start if
#the directory is not there, even if they have permissions to creat it)
#/var/log/jabber/ for the log files

#for the python based transports with no install script:
#they must inherit python and be installed in:
#$(python_get_sitedir)/$package-name

#the user should be the one created here username=group=jabber
