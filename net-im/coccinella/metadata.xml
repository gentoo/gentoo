Coccinella is a Jabber client with a whiteboard. The whiteboard is a shared
desktop which supports text, drawings, images, and multimedia in a number of
formats, such as MP3 and video. It runs in two main modes, a peer-to-peer
configuration and a mode compatible with the Jabber Instant Messaging system. A
flexible plugin architecture may be used to support additional formats. It
should run on any machine that runs Tcl/Tk.
