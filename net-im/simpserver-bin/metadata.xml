SimpServer is the first lightweight instant messaging security gateway for Unix systems. Install SimpServer on a
Unix system and configure IM clients on your local network, and conversations with Simp-equipped parties will be
automatically encrypted. SimpServer can indeed accept simultaneous remote connections and thus secure local and/or
remote clients.

With SimpServer, corporate environments can now benefit from centralized instant messenger encryption. Linux fans
can now secure their MSN conversations. SimpServer is currently beta software and is free for any use.
