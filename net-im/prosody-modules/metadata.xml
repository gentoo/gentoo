		Prosody can be customized extensively using modules (plugins) to change
		its default behaviour and to add new features and functionality.

		Please note that each module is in a different state of development.
		Some are proof-of-concept, others are quite stable and ready for production use.
		Be sure to read the documentation page of any module before installing it on your server.
