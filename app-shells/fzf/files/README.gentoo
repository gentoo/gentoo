To add fzf support to your shell, make sure to use the right file
from /usr/share/fzf.

For bash, add the following line to ~/.bashrc:

# source /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/fzf
# source /usr/share/fzf/key-bindings.bash

Plugins for Vim and Neovim are installed to respective directories
and will work out of the box.

For fzf support in tmux see fzf-tmux(1).
