		fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder. It's an interactive Unix filter for command-line
		that can be used with any list; files, command history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc.
		Fuzzy completion for files and directories can be triggered if the word before the cursor ends with the
		trigger sequence which is by default **.
		To use the fzf key-binding for your shell, make sure to source the right file for your shell
		from /usr/share/fzf/

		For bash, add the following line to ~/.bashrc
		# source /usr/share/fzf/fzf.sh

		Or symlink the fzf bash script
		# ln -s /usr/share/fzf/fzf.sh /etc/bash/bashrc.d/fzf.sh

		For fish, make sure to symlink the file
		# ln -s /usr/share/fzf/fzf.fish /usr/share/fish/functions/fzf.fish

		For zsh, make sure to symlink the file
		# ln -s /usr/share/fzf/fzf.fish /usr/share/zsh/site-contrib/fzf.fish

		Or add the following line to your ~/.zshrc
		# source /usr/share/fzf/fzf.zsh
