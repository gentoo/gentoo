Pdsh is a high-performance, parallel remote shell utility. It has built-in,
thread-safe clients for Berkeley and Kerberos V4 rsh, and can call SSH
externally (though with reduced performance). Pdsh uses a "sliding window"
parallel algorithm to conserve socket resources on the initiating node and
to allow progress to continue while timeouts occur on some connections.
Pdsh is similar to DSH, part of the IBM PSSP software offering, but offers
improved performance and handling of error conditions. It runs on a variety
of platforms (including as a replacement for DSH on AIX/PSSP), but is
primarily developed on Linux.
