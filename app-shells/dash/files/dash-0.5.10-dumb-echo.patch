there's no requirement for `echo` to support escape sequences. bash, by default,
does not, while dash always does.  POSIX permits either behavior:
http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/echo.html

however, since the behavior is not portable, no one should be relying on echo
having any specific behavior.  they should use `printf` when they want an escape
sequence.  it also makes dash smaller & faster to disable this logic entirely.
