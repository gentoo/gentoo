		Scsh has two main components: a process notation for running programs
		and setting up pipelines and redirections, and a complete syscall
		library for low-level access to the operating system, i.e. to POSIX,
		the least common denominator of more or less all Unices, plus widely
		supported extensions such as symbolic links and BSD sockets. 

		Moreover, scsh provides an awk facility for pattern-directed
		computation over streams of records, a rich facility for matching
		regular-expression patterns in strings, event-based interrupt
		handling, user-level threads, a futuristic module system, and an
		interactive environment. 

		Scsh comes with extensive documentation describing these and other
		features.
