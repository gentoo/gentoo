  Since v2.04, bash has allowed you to intelligently program and extend its
  standard completion behavior to achieve complex command lines with just a
  few keystrokes. Imagine typing ssh [Tab] and being able to complete on hosts
  from your ~/.ssh/known_hosts files. Or typing man 3 str [Tab] and getting a
  list of all string handling functions in the UNIX manual. mount system:
  [Tab] would complete on all exported file-systems from the host called
  system, while make [Tab] would complete on all targets in Makefile. This
  project was conceived to produce programmable completion routines for the
  most common Linux/UNIX commands, reducing the amount of typing sysadmins and
  programmers need to do on a daily basis.
