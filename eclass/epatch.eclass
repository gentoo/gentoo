# @FUNCTION: epatch
# @USAGE: [options] [patches] [dirs of patches]
# @DESCRIPTION:
# epatch is designed to greatly simplify the application of patches.  It can
# process patch files directly, or directories of patches.  The patches may be
# compressed (bzip/gzip/etc...) or plain text.  You generally need not specify
# the -p option as epatch will automatically attempt -p0 to -p4 until things
# apply successfully.
#
# If you do not specify any patches/dirs, then epatch will default to the
# directory specified by EPATCH_SOURCE.
#
# Any options specified that start with a dash will be passed down to patch
# for this specific invocation.  As soon as an arg w/out a dash is found, then
# arg processing stops.
#
# When processing directories, epatch will apply all patches that match:
# @CODE
#	if ${EPATCH_FORCE} != "yes"
#		??_${ARCH}_foo.${EPATCH_SUFFIX}
#	else
#		*.${EPATCH_SUFFIX}
# @CODE
# The leading ?? are typically numbers used to force consistent patch ordering.
# The arch field is used to apply patches only for the host architecture with
# the special value of "all" means apply for everyone.  Note that using values
# other than "all" is highly discouraged -- you should apply patches all the
# time and let architecture details be detected at configure/compile time.
#
# If EPATCH_SUFFIX is empty, then no period before it is implied when searching
# for patches to apply.
#
# Refer to the other EPATCH_xxx variables for more customization of behavior.

# Applies user-provided patches to the source tree. The patches are
# taken from /etc/portage/patches/<CATEGORY>/<P-PR|P|PN>[:SLOT]/, where the first
# of these three directories to exist will be the one to use, ignoring
# any more general directories which might exist as well. They must end
# in ".patch" to be applied.
#
# User patches are intended for quick testing of patches without ebuild
# modifications, as well as for permanent customizations a user might
# desire. Obviously, there can be no official support for arbitrarily
# patched ebuilds. So whenever a build log in a bug report mentions that
# user patches were applied, the user should be asked to reproduce the
# problem without these.
#
# Not all ebuilds do call this function, so placing patches in the
# stated directory might or might not work, depending on the package and
# the eclasses it inherits and uses. It is safe to call the function
# repeatedly, so it is always possible to add a call at the ebuild
# level. The first call is the time when the patches will be
# applied.
#
# Ideally, this function should be called after gentoo-specific patches
# have been applied, so that their code can be modified as well, but
# before calls to e.g. eautoreconf, as the user patches might affect
# autotool input files as well.
