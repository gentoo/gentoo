# @PROVIDES: zig-utils
# @BLURB: Functions for working with ZBS (Zig Build System)
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Functions for working with Zig build system and package manager.
# Supports Zig 0.13+.  Exports default functions for convenience.
#
# Note that zig.eclass is mostly tailored for projects that:
# 1) Install something in build.zig steps: "artifacts" (executable,
# libraries, objects), source codes, assets, tests, scripts etc.   But
# many authors also use it to write Zig "modules", build logic
# and/or bindings/wrappers for C/C++ libraries.  They install nothing
# and are only used at build-time, so it's unneccessary and mostly
# useless to make ebuilds for them.
# 2) Have required `target`, `cpu` and optional `optimize` options in
# build.zig that accept standard Zig-style target and optimize mode.
# They are usually created by calling `b.standardTargetOptions` and
# `b.standardOptimizeOption` functions.
#
# For end-user executables, usually it's recommended to patch to call
# these options and upstream it, but in some cases authors have good
# reasons to not have them, f.e. if it is built only for WASM
# platform with ReleaseSmall, and is not intended to run in /usr/bin/.
# In this case, declare dummy options using `b.option` and  ignore
# their values, or else eclass wouldn't work.
#
# Another case is when upstream has `target` option but it has
# custom format and does not accept usual Zig targets, but rather
# something specific to the project like "linux-baseline-lts", or
# combine CPU and target in one option.
# In this case, it's best to rename that option to something like
# `target-custom`, then declare `target` option and make converter
# from one value to other.
#
# For non-executable binaries like C libraries, objects etc. our
# policy is stricter, all 3 options are required and should not
# be ignored, with no exceptions.

# @ECLASS_VARIABLE: ZIG_OPTIONAL
# @PRE_INHERIT
# @DEFAULT_UNSET
# @DESCRIPTION:
# If set to a non-empty value, all logic in zig-utils and
# zig eclasses will be considered optional.  No dependencies
# will be added and no phase functions will be exported.
#
# For zig.eclass users:
# You need to add Zig and pkgconfig dependencies in your BDEPEND, set
# QA_FLAGS_IGNORED and call all phase functions manually.  If you want
# to use "ezig build" directly, call "zig_pkg_setup" before it.
#
# For zig-utils.eclass users: see documentation in
# zig-utils.eclass instead.

# @ECLASS_VARIABLE: ZBS_DEPENDENCIES
# @PRE_INHERIT
# @DEFAULT_UNSET
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Bash associative array with all tarballs that will be fetched by
# "ezig fetch" in zig_src_unpack phase.  Value is URL where
# tarball is located, key is name under which it would be downloaded
# and renamed.  So generally it has effect of "value -> key".
#
# Note: if Zig Build System dependency can't be represented in SRC_URI
# (like direct Git commit URIs), you should do the following
# (zig-ebuilder does archiving automatically for you):
#   1. Archive each folder with dependency content in some tarball,
#      so f.e. if you have 2 Git dependencies, create 2 tarballs.
#   2. Archive all previous tarballs into one combined tarball (also
#      called tarball-tarball from now on), no subdirs, so that eclass
#      can firstly unpack this tarball with "unpack",
#      and secondly unpack its content with "zig fetch".
#   3. (zig-ebuilder can't do this) Host this tarball somewhere
#      and put URL of this tarball in SRC_URI, and archives in
#      ZBS_DEPENDENCIES, keys must be names of archives, values empty.
#
# Example:
# @CODE
# declare -r -A ZBS_DEPENDENCIES=(
# 	[tarball_a-<long-hash>.tar.gz]='URL_A'
# 	[tarball_b-<long-hash>.tar.gz]='URL_B'
#
# 	# If there are Git dependencies:
# 	[git_c-<long-hash>.tar.gz]=''
# 	# Tarball-tarball should contain inside above tarball flatly.
# )
# @CODE

# @ECLASS_VARIABLE: ZBS_DEPENDENCIES_SRC_URI
# @OUTPUT_VARIABLE
# @DEFAULT_UNSET
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Content of ZBS_DEPENDENCIES converted at inherit-time, to be used in
# SRC_URI.  Note that elements with empty keys will be skipped.
# Example:
# @CODE
# SRC_URI="
# 	<URL to project sources, patches, non-Zig resources etc.>
#
# 	# If there are Git dependencies:
# 	# <URL to tarball-tarball>
#
# 	${ZBS_DEPENDENCIES_SRC_URI}
# "

# need to override default optimize mode of this eclass (ReleaseSafe)
# with your default, please use "--release=small" etc. syntax so that
# user can still override it in ZBS_ARGS_EXTRA.
#
# Example:
# @CODE

# 	)
#
# 	zig_src_configure
# }
# @CODE

# Bash string with user-specified arguments to pass to the "zig build"

# It's appended to the ZBS_ARGS during "zig_src_configure".
#
# If this does not have amount of jobs, eclass will try to take amount
# of jobs from MAKEOPTS, and if it also does not have them, it will

# @CODE

# Enabled by default.  Set to OFF to disable these verbose messages.
#
# Note: this variable does not control other options starting with
# "--verbose-", such as "--verbose-link" or "--verbose-cimport".  If
# you need them, add them manually to ZBS_ARGS_EXTRA.

# Package manager option is managed by "zig_src_prepare",
# ebuild and user options are added by "zig_src_configure".
#
# This function is used by "zig_pkg_setup", and it is neccessary
# that args are available as early as possible, so that ebuilds
# could use them in steps like "src_unpack" if neccessary, while
# still having verbosity and amount of jobs from user respected.
#
#
# TODO: currently this function enables "--search-prefix" (1) and
# "--sysroot" (2) only when cross-compiling, should be fixed to
# unconditionally enabling it.
#
# For solving (1) this patch should be reworked and upstreamed:
# https://paste.sr.ht/~bratishkaerik/2ddffe2bf0f8f9d6dfb60403c2e9560334edaa88
#
# (2)
# "--sysroot" should be passed together with "--search-prefix" above,
