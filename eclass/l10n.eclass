# @ECLASS: l10n.eclass
# @DEAD
# Use plocale.eclass as drop-in replacement.
# Functions should be replaced as follows:
# l10n_for_each_locale_do → plocale_for_each_locale
# plocale_for_each_disabled_locale → l10n_for_each_disabled_locale_do
# plocale_find_changes → l10n_find_plocales_changes
# plocale_get_locales → l10n_get_locales
#
# Rationale: Ever since the L10N USE_EXPAND variable was introduced,
# the name of this eclass has caused some confusion, because it operates
# on LINGUAS and is unrelated to L10N.

# @BLURB: convenience functions to handle localizations
# @DEPRECATED: plocale.eclass
# @DESCRIPTION:
# The l10n (localization) eclass offers a number of functions to more
# conveniently handle localizations (translations) offered by packages.
# These are meant to prevent code duplication for such boring tasks as
# determining the cross-section between the user's set LINGUAS and what
# is offered by the package.

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: PLOCALES
# @DEFAULT_UNSET
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Variable listing the locales for which localizations are offered by
# the package.
#
# Example: PLOCALES="cy de el_GR en_US pt_BR vi zh_CN"

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: PLOCALE_BACKUP
# @DEFAULT_UNSET
# @DESCRIPTION:
# In some cases the package fails when none of the offered PLOCALES are
# selected by the user. In that case this variable should be set to a
# default locale (usually 'en' or 'en_US') as backup.
#
# Example: PLOCALE_BACKUP="en_US"

# @FUNCTION: l10n_for_each_locale_do
# @USAGE: <function>
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Convenience function for processing localizations. The parameter should
# be a function (defined in the consuming eclass or ebuild) which takes
# an individual localization as (last) parameter.
#
# Example: l10n_for_each_locale_do install_locale

	done
}

# @FUNCTION: l10n_for_each_disabled_locale_do
# @USAGE: <function>
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Complementary to l10n_for_each_locale_do, this function will process
# locales that are disabled. This could be used for example to remove
# locales from a Makefile, to prevent them from being built needlessly.

		"${@}" ${x} || die "failed to process disabled ${x} locale"
	done
}

# @FUNCTION: l10n_find_plocales_changes
# @USAGE: <translations dir> <filename pre pattern> <filename post pattern>
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Ebuild maintenance helper function to find changes in package offered
# locales when doing a version bump. This could be added for example to
# src_prepare
#
# Example: l10n_find_plocales_changes "${S}/src/translations" "${PN}_" '.ts'

# @FUNCTION: l10n_get_locales
# @USAGE: [disabled]
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Determine which LINGUAS the user has enabled that are offered by the
# package, as listed in PLOCALES, and return them.  In case no locales
# are selected, fall back on PLOCALE_BACKUP.  When the disabled argument
# is given, return the disabled locales instead of the enabled ones.
