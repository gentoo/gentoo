# @BLURB: Standardizing the install of games.
# @DEPRECATED: none
# @DESCRIPTION:
# This eclass makes sure that games are consistently handled in gentoo.
# It installs game files by default in FHS-compatible directories
# like /usr/share/games and sets more restrictive permissions in order
# to avoid some security bugs.
#
# The installation directories as well as the user and group files are
# installed as can be controlled by the user. See the variables like
# GAMES_BINDIR, GAMES_USER etc. below. These are NOT supposed to be set
# by ebuilds!
#
# For a general guide on writing games ebuilds, see:
# https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Games/Ebuild_howto
#
# WARNING: This eclass is DEPRECATED and must not be used by new games
# ebuilds, bug #574082. When writing game ebuilds, no specific eclass
# is needed. For more details, see the QA team policies page:
# https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Quality_Assurance/Policies#Games
