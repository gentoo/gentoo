# @SUPPORTED_EAPIS: 8
# @BLURB: Simplify the installation of GAP packages.
# @DESCRIPTION:
# The main purpose of this eclass is to build and install GAP packages
# that typically occupy the dev-gap category. Most GAP packages do not
# support an install target out of the box, so the default installation
# is "by hand," with attention paid to those directories that are part
# of the recommended layout. The prepare, configure, and compile phases
# do however try to support packages having a real build system.
#
# GAP itself has four "required" packages that are packaged separately,
# making dependencies between them somewhat weird. The four required
# packages are,
#
#   * dev-gap/gapdoc
#   * dev-gap/primgrp
#   * dev-gap/smallgrp
#   * dev-gap/transgrp
#
# Those four packages will have only sci-mathematics/gap added to
# RDEPEND. All other packages will have the four required packages above
# added to RDEPEND in addition to sci-mathematics/gap. In theory it
# would be better to list all dependencies explicitly rather than
# grouping together the "required" four, but this is how upstream GAP
# works, and is what all GAP packages expect; for example, most test
# suites fail without the required packages but make no attempt to load
# them.
#
# If you need a version constraint on sci-mathematics/gap, you'll have
# to specify it yourself. Compiled packages will likely need
# sci-mathematics/gap in DEPEND as well, and may also want a subslot
# dependency.

# @FUNCTION: gap-pkg_dir
# @DESCRIPTION:
# The directory into which the gap package should be installed. The
# accepted current location is /usr/$(get_libdir)/gap/pkg, but
# technically this depends on the econf call in sci-mathematics/gap.
gap-pkg_dir() {
	echo "/usr/$(get_libdir)/gap/pkg/${PN}"

# @FUNCTION: _gap-pkg_gaproot
# @INTERNAL
# @DESCRIPTION:
# The directory containing sysinfo.gap. This is frequently passed to GAP
# packages via ./configure --with-gaproot or as a positional argument to
# hand-written configure scripts. We also use it to find the value of
# $GAParch, which is contained in sysinfo.gap. The "gaproot" is
# implicitly determined by the econf call in sci-mathematics/gap. As a
# result, calling this function requires sci-mathematics/gap at
# build-time.
_gap-pkg_gaproot() {
	echo "${ESYSROOT}/usr/$(get_libdir)/gap"

# @FUNCTION: gap-pkg_econf
# @USAGE: [extra econf args]
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Call econf, passing the value of _gap-pkg_gaproot to --with-gaproot.
# All arguments to gap-pkg_econf are passed through to econf.
#
# @EXAMPLE
# src_configure() {
# 	gap-pkg_econf --with-external-libsemigroups
# }
#
gap-pkg_econf() {
	econf --with-gaproot="$(_gap-pkg_gaproot)" "${@}"
}

# @FUNCTION: gap-pkg_src_configure
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Handle both autoconf configure scripts and the hand-written ones used
# by many GAP packages. We determine which one we're dealing with by
# running ./configure --help; an autoconf configure script will mention
# "PREFIX" in the output, the others will not.
#
# Autoconf configure scripts are configured using gap-pkg_econf, while
# hand-written ones are executed directly with _gap-pkg_gaproot as their
# sole positional argument.

			# not print usage information with --help.

# build without this.

# @FUNCTION: gap-pkg_enable_tests
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Amend IUSE, RESTRICT, and BDEPEND for a package with a test suite.
# This is modeled on similar functions in the distutils-r1 and
# elisp-common eclasses, except here only a single default testing
# strategy is supported. All runtime and post-merge dependencies are
# added as build dependencies if USE=test is set.

	# the ebuild is maintained separately by the package manager. We add
	# PDEPEND too because we use it to break some circular dependencies
	# between e.g. polycyclic and alnuth.
	BDEPEND+=" test? ( ${_GAP_PKG_RDEPEND} ${RDEPEND} ${PDEPEND} ) "
}

# @FUNCTION: gap-pkg_src_test
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Run this package's test suite if it has one. The GAP TestPackage
# function is the standard way to do this, but it does rely on the
# package itself to get a few things right, like running the tests
# verbosely and exiting with the appropriate code. The alternative would
# be run TestDirectory ourselves on "tst", but that has its own issues;
# in particular many packages have set-up code that is run only with
# TestPackage. YMMV.

	# We would prefer --bare to -A so that we can test (say) primgrp
	# after installing only gapdoc and not smallgrp or transgrp. But,
	# that would cause problems for basically every non-required
	# package, because they usually don't explicitly load the four
	# "required" packages in their test suites. So we use -A unless
	# this is one of the chosen four.

	# Fake the directory structure that GAP needs to be able to find
	# packages with a symlink under ${T}, then prepend ${T} to the list

	# There's nothing you can do about that, but now you know.
	#
	# The pipe to tee is more important than it looks. Any test suite
	# involving dev-gap/browse is likely to bork the user's terminal.
	# The "browse" package is however smart enough to figure out when
	# stdout is not a tty, and avoids breaking it in that case. So by
	# piping to tee, we encourage it not to do anything too crazy.

# @ECLASS_VARIABLE: GAP_PKG_EXTRA_INSTALL
# @DEFAULT_UNSET
# @DESCRIPTION:
# A bash array of extra files and directories to install recursively at
# the root of this package's directory tree. For example, if you have a
# package that mostly follows the suggested layout (described in the
# gap-pkg_src_install documentation) but also includes a "data"
# directory, you should set
#
#   GAP_PKG_EXTRA_INSTALL=( data )
#
# to install the data directory without having to override the entire
# src_install phase.

# @ECLASS_VARIABLE: GAP_PKG_HTML_DOCDIR
# @DESCRIPTION:
# The directory inside the tarball where the HTML documentation is
# located. This is _usually_ "doc", which conforms to the suggested
# GAPDoc layout and is the default value of this variable. Many
# packages however use a top-level "htm" directory instead. The named
# directory will be installed to gap-pkg_dir and symlinked to the usual
# location under /usr/share/doc. As a result, you should only use this
# for directories referenced by PackageInfo.g or by some other part of
# the package. HTML documentation whose location doesn't need to be
# known to the package at runtime should instead be installed with
# HTML_DOCS or a similar mechanism.
: "${GAP_PKG_HTML_DOCDIR:=doc}"

# @FUNCTION: gap-pkg_src_install
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Install a GAP package that follows the suggested layout,
#
#   https://docs.gap-system.org/doc/ref/chap76.html
#
# In particular:
#
# 1. All GAP source files (*.g) in $S are installed.
#
# 2. If a library directory named "gap" or "lib" exists,
#    it is installed.
#
# 3. If a binary directory "bin" exists, it is installed.
#
# 4. If a "doc" directory exists, we assume GAPDoc conventions
#    (https://docs.gap-system.org/pkg/gapdoc/doc/chap5.html) and install
#    what we find there. Unfortunately for us, each package's
#    PackageInfo.g contains a "PackageDoc" section that points to this
#    documentation, and we can't break the paths it references. Instead,
#    we try to dosym the human-readable parts of the documentation (PDF
#    manuals) into appropriate Gentoo locations.
#
# 5. We consult GAP_PKG_HTML_DOCDIR for the HTML documentation and repeat
#    the process above.
#
# A few GAP packages have autotools build systems with working "make
# install" routines, but most don't. So for the time being we omit that
# step. It's harder to work around the packages that don't support it
# than the other way around.
