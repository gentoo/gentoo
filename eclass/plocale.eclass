# @BLURB: convenience functions to handle localizations
# @DESCRIPTION:
# The plocale (localization) eclass offers a number of functions to more
# conveniently handle localizations (translations) offered by packages.
# These are meant to prevent code duplication for such boring tasks as
# determining the cross-section between the user's set LINGUAS and what
# is offered by the package.
#
# Typical usage in an ebuild looks like this:
#
# @CODE
#   PLOCALES="de en fr pt_BR zh_CN"
#   PLOCALE_BACKUP="en"
# @CODE
#
# There, PLOCALES is the list of locales that the package supports.
# PLOCALE_BACKUP is optional and specifies a single locale, which is
# used as a fallback if none of the PLOCALES matches the user's
# LINGUAS selection.
#
# The eclass functions then operate on the intersection of the package's
# PLOCALES with the user's LINGUAS setting.  (As a special case, if the
# LINGUAS variable is unset then all items in PLOCALES will be used,
# emulating the behaviour of gettext.)
#
# In the following simple example, locale specific README files
# (e.g. README.de, README.en) are added to the DOCS variable:
#
# @CODE
#   my_add_to_docs() {
#       DOCS+=( ${1}.${2} )
#   }
#   plocale_for_each_locale my_add_to_docs README
# @CODE
#
# A complementary function plocale_for_each_disabled_locale exists as
# well, which operates on the set difference of PLOCALES and LINGUAS,
# i.e. on the locales that the user hasn't enabled.  For example, it can
# be used to remove unnecessary locale files.
#
# Finally, plocale_find_changes is purely a helper function for ebuild
# maintenance.  It can be used to scan a directory for available
# translations and check if the ebuild's PLOCALES are still up to date.

# @ECLASS_VARIABLE: PLOCALES
# @DEFAULT_UNSET
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Variable listing the locales for which localizations are offered by
# the package.
#
# Example: PLOCALES="cy de el_GR en_US pt_BR vi zh_CN"

# @ECLASS_VARIABLE: PLOCALE_BACKUP
# @DEFAULT_UNSET
# @DESCRIPTION:
# In some cases the package fails when none of the offered PLOCALES are
# selected by the user.  In that case this variable should be set to a
# default locale (usually 'en' or 'en_US') as backup.
#
# Example: PLOCALE_BACKUP="en_US"

# @FUNCTION: plocale_for_each_locale
# @USAGE: <function> [<args>...]
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Convenience function for processing all enabled localizations.
# The parameter should be a function (defined in the consuming eclass
# or ebuild) which takes an individual locale as its (last) parameter.
#
# Example: plocale_for_each_locale install_locale

		"$@" ${x} || die "failed to process enabled ${x} locale"
	done
}

# @FUNCTION: plocale_for_each_disabled_locale
# @USAGE: <function> [<args>...]
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Complementary to plocale_for_each_locale, this function will process
# locales that are disabled.  This could be used for example to remove
# locales from a Makefile, to prevent them from being built needlessly.
plocale_for_each_disabled_locale() {

}

# @FUNCTION: plocale_find_changes
# @USAGE: <translations dir> <filename pre pattern> <filename post pattern>
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Ebuild maintenance helper function to find changes in package offered
# locales when doing a version bump.  This could be added for example
# to src_prepare.
#
# Example: plocale_find_changes "${S}/src/translations" "${PN}_" '.ts'

# @USAGE: [disabled]
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Determine which LINGUAS the user has enabled that are offered by the
# package, as listed in PLOCALES, and return them.  In case no locales
# are selected, fall back on PLOCALE_BACKUP.  When the disabled argument
# is given, return the disabled locales instead of the enabled ones.
