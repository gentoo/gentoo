		The reusable library known as the GNAT Component Collection (GNATColl)
		is based on one main principle: general-purpose packages that are part
		of the GNAT technology should also be available to GNAT user
		application code. The compiler front end, the GNAT Programming Studio
		(GPS) Interactive Development Environment, and the GNAT Tracker
		web-based interface all served as sources for the components.

		The GNATColl components complement the predefined Ada and GNAT
		libraries and deal with a range of common programming issues including
		string and text processing, memory management, and file handling.
		Several of the components are especially useful in enterprise
		applications.
