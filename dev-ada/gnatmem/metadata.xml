		activity in a program, and displays information about incorrect
		deallocations and possible sources of memory leaks. It provides three
		type of information:

		General information concerning memory management, such as the total
		number of allocations and deallocations, the amount of allocated memory
		and the high water mark, i.e. the largest amount of allocated memory in
		the course of program execution.
		Backtraces for all incorrect deallocations, that is to say
		deallocations which do not correspond to a valid allocation.
		Information on each allocation that is potentially the origin of a
		memory leak.
