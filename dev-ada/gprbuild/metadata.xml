		construction of multi-language systems. It removes complexity from
		multi-language development by allowing developers to quickly and easily
		compile and link software written in a combination of languages
		including Ada, Assembler, C, C++, and Fortran. Easily extendable by
		users to cover new toolchains and languages it is primarily aimed at
		projects of all sizes organized into subsystems and libraries and is
		particularly well-suited for compiled languages.
