<longdescription>GtkAda is the technology that lets you implement the next generation of Ada 95 GUIs in an efficient and platform-independent manner. In addition to providing over 100 widgets and allowing you to use portable low-level drawing primitives, GtkAda has a pluggable look-and-feel and comes with a high-level GUI builder that allows round-trip GUI generation and update.</longdescription>
