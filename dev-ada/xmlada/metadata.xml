		XML/Ada is a set of modules that provide a simple manipulation of XML
		streams. It supports the whole XML 1.1 specifications, and can parse
		any file that follows this standard (including the contents of the DTD,
		although no validation of the document is done based on those).

		It also provides support for a number of other standard associated
		with XML, like SAX, DOM and XML schemas.

		In addition, it includes a module to manipulate Unicode streams, since
		this is required by the XML standard.
