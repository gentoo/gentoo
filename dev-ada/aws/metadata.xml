		AWS is a complete framework to develop Web based applications. The main part
		of the framework is the embedded Web server. This small yet powerful Web
		server can be embedded into your application so your application will be
		able to talk with a standard Web browser like Microsoft Internet Explorer or
		Firefox for example. Around this Web server a lot of services have been
		developed.
