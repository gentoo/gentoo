		This present project (e3) is a Python framework to ease the
		development of portable automated build systems (compilation,
		dependencies management, binary code packaging, and automated
		testing).
		The e3 framework is split across multiple Python packages named
		e3-name and sharing the same namespace: e3.
		e3-core contains several packages that help writing portable code
		running on both Windows and UNIX systems. It also contains Anod, a
		build and test driver based on Anod specification files that handle
		dependencies management, create binary packages, and execute test
		suites. The driver inputs are Python files ending with .anod called
		Anod specification files describing:
		dependencies (either for building, installing, or testing a product)
		required Git or Subversion repositories
		list of action to execute for each of the Anod actions or primitives
		(build, install, test, …)
