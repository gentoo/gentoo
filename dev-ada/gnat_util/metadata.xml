		Gnat_Util is a library uniting a number of GNAT sources that are used by
		different tools. At the moment Gnat_Util provides GNAT sources needed by ASIS,
		GNATCOLL and Gprbuild. Its main purpose is allowing to simultaneously use
		tools like ASIS and GNATCOLL (and other ones based on GNAT sources, if they
		are to come), which would normally cause name conflicts between the same GNAT
		sources that they use. Building both of them using same set of sources that
		is Gnat_Util solves this problem.
