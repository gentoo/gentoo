	Ada Semantic Interface Specification is a published international ISO 
	standard (ISO/IEC 15291:1999). ASIS represents a compiler independent 
	toolset consisting of a set of standard Ada interfaces which allow extraction 
	of information about user source programs. This information was previously 
	only available inside the Ada compilers themselves or exported in 
	non-standard, and thus non portable mechanisms.
	This is the ACT version.
