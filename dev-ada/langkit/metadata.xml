		Langkit (nickname for language kit) is a tool whose purpose is to make
		it easy to create syntactic and semantic analysis engines. Write a
		language specification in our Python DSL and Langkit will generate for
		you an Ada library with bindings for the C and Python programming
		languages.
		The generated library is meant to provide a basis to write tooling,
		including tools working on potentially changing and incorrect code,
		such as IDEs.
