		Ivy is a powerful dependencies manager with transitive dependencies
		support and much more features.

		With Ivy you define the dependencies of your module in an xml file,
		called an ivy file. Then you usually ask ivy to retrieve your dependencies
		to a local lib dir, and it does it for you by locating the artifacts of
		your dependencies in repositories, such as ibiblio.
