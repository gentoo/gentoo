		The Commons FileUpload package makes it easy to add robust,
		high-performance, file upload capability to your servlets and web
		applications.

		FileUpload parses HTTP requests which conform to RFC 1867, "Form-based
		File Upload in HTML". That is, if an HTTP request is submitted using the
		POST method, and with a content type of "multipart/form-data", then
		FileUpload can parse that request, and make the results available in a
		manner easily used by the caller.
