	  This projects contains Jackson extension component for reading and writing XML encoded data.

	  Further, the goal is to emulate how JAXB data-binding works with "Code-first" approach (that is, no support is added for "Schema-first" approach). Support for JAXB annotations is provided by JAXB annotation module; this module provides low-level abstractions (JsonParser, JsonGenerator, JsonFactory) as well as small number of higher level overrides needed to make data-binding work.
