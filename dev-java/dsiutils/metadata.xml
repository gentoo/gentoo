		The DSI utilities are a mish mash of classes accumulated during the last
		ten years in projects developed at the DSI (Dipartimento di Scienze
		dell'Informazione, e.g., Information Sciences Department) of the
		Universit√† degli Studi di Milano. They were originally distributed in
		several projects (mainly in MG4J) but we finally decided to gather all
		the material in a single place.
