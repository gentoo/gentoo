		The DSI utilities are a mish mash of classes accumulated during the last
		ten years in projects developed at the DSI (Dipartimento di Scienze
		dell'Informazione, e.g., Information Sciences Department) of the
		Università degli Studi di Milano. They were originally distributed in
		several projects (mainly in MG4J) but we finally decided to gather all
		the material in a single place.
