		&gt;snip&lt; is an Ant task designed to help with the single-sourcing
		of program documentation. This task extracts snippets of text from files,
		placing them into properties in the Ant project. These properties can
		then be used by any other Ant task, and are particularly useful when
		referenced by &gt;filter&lt;s within the &gt;copy&lt; task.
