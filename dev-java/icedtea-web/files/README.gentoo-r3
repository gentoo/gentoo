Browser plugin
--------------

The IcedTea browser plugin (NPPlugin) is no longer available,
as modern browsers no longer support this plugin format.

JVM selection
-------------

By default, Web Start uses the JVM
selected via eselect environment variable.
Note that this doesn't have to be an IcedTea. Openjdk will also work.
Also note that the selected JVM must have been installed with the
'headless-awt' USE flag *disabled*.
The choice can be overridden using the itweb-settings program.
Simply blank out the field to restore the default behaviour.
