	<longdescription>This module was the foundation for all JIDE commercial products. It was delivered as jide-common.jar in all former releases. In April of 2007, JIDE Software open sourced the module under GPL+classpath exception, hoping more and more people will join the project and push it to the next level.</longdescription>
