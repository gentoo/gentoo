		iCal4j is a Java library used to read and write iCalendar data streams
		as defined in RFC2445. The iCalendar standard provides a common data
		format used to store information about calendar-specific data such as
		events, appointments, to-do lists, etc. All of the popular calendaring
		tools, such as Lotus Notes, Outlook and Apple's iCal also support the
		iCalendar standard.

		Providing both a parser and an object model, iCal4j allows you to either
		modify existing iCalendar data or create new data models. Validation is
		also provided to ensure the data maintains a state consistent with the
		specification.
