	The Tcl/Java project's goal is to make integrating the Java platform and the
	Tcl scripting language as easy as possible. The project actually consists of
	two distinct packages, called Tcl Blend and Jacl. It is important to
	understand what each package provides and in what situations one might choose
	to use Jacl or Tcl Blend.

	Tcl Blend is a Tcl extension that makes use of JNI to facilitate communication
	between a Java interpreter and a Tcl interpreter. Tcl Blend is typically used
	to load a Java interpreter into an existing Tcl process, so that functionality
	implemented in Java can be accessed via Tcl. One can also load Tcl Blend and
	Tcl into a Java process, which is a great way to add scripting functionality
	to an existing Java application. Because Tcl Blend is a normal Tcl extension,
	one can use it with other popular Tcl extensions like Tk, Expect, and Itcl.

	Jacl is a self-contained implementation of a Tcl interpreter, written entirely
	in Java. Jacl also includes features that facilitate communication between a
	Java interpreter and a Tcl interpreter. Jacl is typically used to incorporate
	scripting functionality into an existing Java application. For users who want
	to avoid adding any native code to their Java applications, Jacl is the ideal
	solution.

	Tcl Blend and Jacl define both a Tcl API and a Java API that make it easy to
	call Java code from Tcl or call Tcl code from Java. For example, one could
	allocate a Java object in a Tcl script and interactively invoke Java methods
	on the object. It is also easy to use the supplied API to evaluate a Tcl
	procedure from a Java method or implement Tcl procudures in Java. The flexible
	API and wealth of implementation options provided by the Tcl/Java project make
	integrating Tcl and Java easy.
