    <longdescription>The Jetty project provides an implementation of the TLS extension for ALPN for OpenJDK 7 and OpenJDK 8. ALPN allows the application layer to negotiate which protocol to use over the secure connection.

Any protocol can be negotiated by ALPN within a TLS connection. The protocols that are most commonly negotiated are HTTP/2 (for browsers that support it) and, historically, SPDY. The ALPN implementation is therefore not HTTP/2 or SPDY specific in any way. Jetty's ALPN implementation, although hosted under the umbrella of the Jetty project, is independent of Jetty (the Servlet Container); you can use the ALPN implementation in any other Java network server.</longdescription>
