Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes which provides
scripting language support within Java applications, and access to Java
objects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows one to write
JSPs in languages other than Java while providing access to the Java
class library. In addition, BSF permits any Java application to be
implemented in part (or dynamically extended) by a language that is
embedded within it. This is achieved by providing an API that permits
calling scripting language engines from within Java, as well as an
object registry that exposes Java objects to these scripting language
engines.
