# It's unclear how upstream gets their "dev.compile.test" target to compile
# without this - it could be that their testing is done with the local tools/
# dir, and that some assumptions are made somewhere in the bulid system that
# don't apply when the tools dir is elsewhere. Either way, this fixes it.
#
# a Pull Request (of sorts) has been issued with upstream to incorporate this
# change. I would list the PR link here, but they use gerrit, and i don't
# understand what happened to my submission after I issued
# `git push upstream HEAD:refs/for/master`
