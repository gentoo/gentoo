JCalendar is a Java date chooser bean for graphically picking a date. JCalendar
is composed of several other Java beans, a JDayChooser, a JMonthChooser and a
JYearChooser. All these beans have a locale property, provide several icons
(Color 16x16, Color 32x32, Mono 16x16 and Mono 32x32) and their own locale
property editor. So they can easily be used in GUI builders.
