		The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for
		modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform. A key
		element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application level: Spring focuses
		on the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams can focus on application-level
		business logic, without unnecessary ties to specific deployment environments.
