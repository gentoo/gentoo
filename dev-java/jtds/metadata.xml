	jTDS is an open source 100% pure Java (type 4) JDBC 3.0 driver for Microsoft SQL
	Server (6.5, 7, 2000 and 2005) and Sybase (10, 11, 12). jTDS is based on the
	work of the FreeTDS project and is currently the fastest complete JDBC driver
	for SQL Server and Sybase. Starting with release 0.9 jTDS is 100% JDBC 3.0
	compatible, supporting forward-only and scrollable/updateable ResultSets,
	multiple concurrent (completely independent) Statements per Connection and
	implementing all the DatabaseMetaData and ResultSetMetaData methods.
