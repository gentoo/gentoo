<longdescription>
	The Betwixt library provides an XML introspection mechanism for mapping
	beans to XML in a flexible way. It is implemented using an XMLIntrospector
	and XMLBeanInfo classes which are similar to the standard Introspector and
	BeanInfo from the Java Beans specification.

	Betwixt provides a way of turning beans into XML as well as automatically
	generating digester rules in a way that can be customized on a per type
	manner in the same way that the BeanInfo mechanism can be used to customize
	the default introspection on a java object.
