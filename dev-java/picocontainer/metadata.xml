PicoContainer is very simple container for very simple components.  It
honors the Inversion of control pattern (IoC) in a way that we calling
it type 3 IoC.  See below for types. Components are typically going to
live inside the same JVM. The idea is that this might scale from
embedded containers for simple beans to enterprise and distributed
applications.
