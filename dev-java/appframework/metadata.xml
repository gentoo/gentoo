		 The JSR-296  Swing Application Framework prototype implementation is a small set of Java classes that simplify building desktop applications. The prototype provides infrastructure that's common to most desktop applications:

    * Application lifecyle, notably GUI startup and shutdown.
    * Support for managing and loading resources, like strings, formatted messages, images, colors, fonts, and other types common to desktop applications.
    * Support for defining, managing, and binding Actions, including Actions that run asynchronously (in the "background").
    * Persistent session state: support for automatically and selectively saving GUI state from one run of an application to the next.
