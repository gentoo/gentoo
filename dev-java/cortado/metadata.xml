		Cortado is an open-source cross-browser and cross-platform video
		playback solution based upon Java technology. Leveraging the huge
		installation base of Java it allows web-authors to deliver Ogg Theora
		content without having to worry about the media playback setup
		installed on customers' machines. This enables e.g. Wikipedia to
		deliver Ogg Theora video content embedded into articles to millions of
		users. Originally developed at Fluendo, Cortado's latest versions are
		now maintained by Xiph.org. If you're interested in using free media
		delivery technology, e.g. to avoid the costs adjunctive to non-free
		technologies like H.264, and want to reach a big potential user base,
		Cortado may be the solution you've been looking for.
