Tapestry is a powerful, open-source, all-Java framework for creating leading edge web applications in Java.

Tapestry reconceptualizes web application development in terms of objects, methods and properties instead of URLs and query parameters.

Tapestry is an alternative to scripting environments such as JavaServer Pages or Velocity. Tapestry goes far further, providing a complete framework for creating extremely dynamic applications with minimal amounts of coding.
