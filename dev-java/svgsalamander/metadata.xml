	SVG Salamander is an SVG engine for Java that's designed to be small,
	fast, and allow programmers to use it with a minimum of fuss. It's in
	particular targeted for making it easy to integrate SVG into Java games
	and making it much easier for artists to design 2D game content - from
	rich interactive menus to charts and graphcs to complex animations.
