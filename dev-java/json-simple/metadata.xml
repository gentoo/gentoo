	<longdescription lang="en">Why the Simple Java toolkit (also named as JSON.simple) for JSON?
	When I use JSON as the data exchange format between the AJAX client and JSP
	for the first time, what worry me mostly is how to encode Java strings and
	numbers correctly in the server side so the AJAX client will receive a well
	formed JSON data. When I looked into the 'JSON in Java' directory in JSON
	website,I found that wrappers to JSONObject and JSONArray can be simpler,
	due to the simplicity of JSON itself. So I wrote the JSON.simple package.</longdescription>
