XMLBeans is a tool that allows you to access the full power of XML in a Java
friendly way. It is an XML-Java binding tool. The idea is that you can take
advantage the richness and features of XML and XML Schema and have these
features mapped as naturally as possible to the equivalent Java language and
typing constructs. XMLBeans uses XML Schema to compile Java interfaces and
classes that you can then use to access and modify XML instance data. Using
XMLBeans is similar to using any other Java interface/class, you will see things
like getFoo or setFoo just as you would expect when working with Java. While a
major use of XMLBeans is to access your XML instance data with strongly typed
Java classes there are also API's that allow you access to the full XML infoset
(XMLBeans keeps full XML Infoset fidelity) as well as to allow you to reflect
into the XML schema itself through an XML Schema Object model.
