Contains com.google.common.util.concurrent.internal.InternalFutureFailureAccess
and InternalFutures. Most users will never need to use this artifact. Its
classes are conceptually a part of Guava, but they're in this separate artifact
so that Android libraries can use them without pulling in all of Guava (just as
they can use ListenableFuture by depending on the listenablefuture artifact).
