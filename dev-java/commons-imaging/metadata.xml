	<longdescription>Apache Commons Imaging, previously known as Apache Commons Sanselan, is a library that reads and writes a variety of image formats, including fast parsing of image info (size, color space, ICC profile, etc.) and metadata.

This library is pure Java. Compared to typical image I/O libraries in native code, it's more portable, and should be more reliable and more secure against corrupt/malicious images, yet still performs reasonably well. It's easier to use than ImageIO/JAI/java.awt.Toolkit (Sun/Java's image support), supports more formats (and supports them more correctly). It also provides easy access to metadata.

Imaging was working and was used by a number of projects in production even before version 1.0.</longdescription>
