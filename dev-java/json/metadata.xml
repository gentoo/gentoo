	<longdescription>
		JSON is a light-weight, language independent, data interchange format. See http://www.JSON.org/ The files in this package implement JSON encoders/decoders in Java. It also includes the capability to convert between JSON and XML, HTTP headers, Cookies, and CDL. This is a reference implementation. There is a large number of JSON packages in Java. Perhaps someday the Java community will standardize on one. Until then, choose carefully. The license includes this restriction: \"The software shall be used for good, not evil.\" If your conscience cannot live with that, then choose a different package.
