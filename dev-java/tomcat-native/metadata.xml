	Native library for Tomcat to use the Apache Portable Runtime to
	provide superior scalability, performance, and better integration with
	native server technologies. The Apache Portable Runtime is a highly
	portable library that is at the heart of Apache HTTP Server 2.x. APR
	has many uses, including access to advanced IO functionality (such as
	sendfile, epoll and OpenSSL), OS level functionality (random number
	generation, system status, etc), and native process handling (shared
	memory, NT pipes and Unix sockets).
