		Native library for Tomcat to use the Apache Portable Runtime to
		provide superior scalability, performance, and better integration with
		native server technologies. The Apache Portable Runtime is a highly
		portable library that is at the heart of Apache HTTP Server 2.x. APR
		has many uses, including access to advanced IO functionality (such as
		sendfile, epoll and OpenSSL), OS level functionality (random number
		generation, system status, etc), and native process handling (shared
		memory, NT pipes and Unix sockets).
