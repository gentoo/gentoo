		An elegant set of language bindings to allow you to write
		native GNOME/GTK applications in Java. Works with both
		traditional Java VMs and also with GCJ, allowing the creation
		of native Linux executable binaries.

		These libraries all come from the java-gnome project, which in
		turn is part of the official suite of GNOME language bindings.

		As of java-gnome 2.8, the previously monolithic package was
		split into numerous individual libraries to allow more
		modular use. Those libraries are libgtk-java, libgnome-java,
		libgconf-java, libglade-java, etc.

		This ebuild is a meta package which simply depends on the
		various libraries which make up the complete java-gnome suite.

		In all likelihood (especially if you're developing apps) this
		is what you want to emerge.
