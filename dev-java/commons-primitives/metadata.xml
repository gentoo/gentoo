 Apache Jakarta Commons Primitives provides a collection of types and
 utilities optimized for working with Java primitives (boolean, byte,
 char, double, float, int, long, short). Generally, the
 Commons-Primitives classes are smaller, faster and easier to work with
 than their purely Object based alternatives.
