# This file specifies packages that are considered deprecated (but not
# masked yet).  This will cause QA tools to report dependencies on those
# packages as requiring replacement.
#
# When you add an entry to the top of this file, add your name, the date
# in the UTC timezone, and an explanation of why something is getting
# deprecated.
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # This is no longer supported upstream, please switch to dev-foo/bar.
## dev-foo/foo

# which ensures a sound server is installed via PDEPEND.

# Sam James <sam@gentoo.org> (2023-05-30)
# Removed from GStreamer 1.20.

#
# Possibly adding version constraints if package declares them.

# Sam James <sam@gentoo.org> (2023-04-07)
# Inactive upstream, doesn't support newer Rubies.
# Please port your package to use dev-ruby/erubis instead.
dev-ruby/erubis

# Sam James <sam@gentoo.org> (2023-04-07)
# No longer supported upstream, fork of dev-ruby/listen.
# Please port your package to use dev-ruby/listen instead.
dev-ruby/sass-listen

# Sam James <sam@gentoo.org> (2023-04-06)
# net-libs/libgsasl and net-misc/gsasl are now merged together.
# Please depend on net-misc/gsasl[server] for the server and
# net-misc/gsasl[client] for the client.

# Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> (2023-01-30)
# The package is on keep-alive by Debian.  Nevertheless, they can't
# keep up with changes in dev-python/setuptools, and they do not accept
# bug reports.  PEP517 build systems are simply a no-go for this class
# of packages (partially due to the limitations of wheel format), meson
# and autotools are both much better choices.
dev-python/python-distutils-extra

# Sam James <sam@gentoo.org> (2022-12-29)
# Doesn't work correctly on newer kernels/hardware. Events may go unreported
# if using sys-apps/edac-utils. See app-admin/rasdaemon's README for the technical
# details. Please migrate to app-admin/rasdaemon instead.

# Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> (2022-12-24)
# Unmaintained with last release in 2019.  We already patched it to work
# with Python 3.9+.  The upstream code is also vulnerable
# to CVE-2022-40899.  Above all, this library is completely redundant
# to packages not supporting Python 2 anymore.
dev-python/future

# Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> (2022-10-17)
# Nosetests are no longer maintained (since 2015!), are completely
# broken with Python 3.11, and we were already patching it to make it
# work with prior Python versions.  If your package still needs it
# (sic!), then either port it to use a maintained test framework (pytest
# preferably) or last rite it.
dev-python/nose

# Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> (2022-10-14)
# The toml package is unmaintained (last release in 2020) and does not
# implement TOML 1.0.  The recommended alternatives include the built-in
# tomllib module, dev-python/tomli, dev-python/tomli-w
# and dev-python/tomlkit.  Please consult Guide for porting tips:

# Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> (2022-06-19)
# Test automation tools.  They are generally used to run the test suite
# across multiple Python versions, i.e. what our eclasses do for you
# already.  They usually can't work inside network sandbox (since they
# fetch and install all the dependencies inside the venv), so even
# if they are listed in dependencies, your package probably does not
# actually need them to run tests.
