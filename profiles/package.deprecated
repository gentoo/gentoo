# This file specifies packages that are considered deprecated (but not
# masked yet).  This will cause QA tools to report dependencies on those
# packages as requiring replacement.
#
# When you add an entry to the top of this file, add your name, the date
# in the UTC timezone, and an explanation of why something is getting
# deprecated.
#
## Example:

## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # This is no longer supported upstream, please switch to dev-foo/bar.
## dev-foo/foo

# Nosetests are no longer maintained (since 2015!), are completely
# broken with Python 3.11, and we were already patching it to make it
# work with prior Python versions.  If your package still needs it
# (sic!), then either port it to use a maintained test framework (pytest
# preferably) or last rite it.
#
# Case is also unmaintained (since 2018).  Nose-random has had last
# commit in 2016 and was not even released to pypi!

# The toml package is unmaintained (last release in 2020) and does not
# implement TOML 1.0.  The recommended alternatives include the built-in
# tomllib module, dev-python/tomli, dev-python/tomli-w
# and dev-python/tomlkit.  Please consult Guide for porting tips:

# dev-python/tox is a wrapper to run test suite in a virtual
# environment, possibly for multiple Python versions.  It cannot really
# work inside network sandbox, and your package probably does not use
# it anyway.
dev-python/tox

# Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> (2022-06-17)
# So far not a single dependency on dev-python/versioneer was correct.
# This package is a generator for "versioneer.py" file that is included
# in the sdist tarball.  Your package most likely only imports that file
# and does not need dev-python/versioneer.  If it really does, please
# ping me.
dev-python/versioneer

# Obsolete virtual.

# dependency to that instead.
