# This file specifies packages that are considered deprecated (but not
# masked yet).  This will cause QA tools to report dependencies on those
# packages as requiring replacement.

# When you add an entry to the top of this file, add your name, the date
# in the UTC timezone, and an explanation of why something is getting
# deprecated.

## Example:

## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # This is no longer supported upstream, please switch to dev-foo/bar.
## dev-foo/foo

# Live ebuilds for Emacs from Git have been consolidated into the
# app-editors/emacs package, which makes the virtual unnecessary.
# Packages should depend on >=app-editors/emacs-23.1:* instead.
# See the documentation of elisp-common.eclass for details.

# The pycrypto project is long dead, and has been forked into
# dev-python/pycryptodome that's not entirely API compatible.  Many
# upstreams prefer switching to dev-python/cryptography instead.
dev-python/pycrypto

# Michał Górny <mgorny@gentoo.org> (2019-12-09)
# Test coverage reporting is not useful for Gentoo ebuilds.  The deps
# against coverage plugins are either entirely spurious, or the build
# systems need to be fixed to work without them.

# These golang libraries should be vendored either by upstream or via
# the EGO_VENDOR variable.
