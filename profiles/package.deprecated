# Ulrich Müller <ulm@gentoo.org> (2019-12-21)
# Live ebuilds for Emacs from Git have been consolidated into the
# app-editors/emacs package, which makes the virtual unnecessary.
# Packages should depend on >=app-editors/emacs-23.1:* instead.
# See the documentation of elisp-common.eclass for details.
# Removal (without prior masking) after ~app-editors/emacs-27.1
# is marked stable. Bug #291296.

# Test coverage reporting is not useful for Gentoo ebuilds.  The deps
# against coverage plugins are either entirely spurious, or the build
# systems need to be fixed to work without them.
