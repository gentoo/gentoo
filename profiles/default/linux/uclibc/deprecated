uClibc-ng is mostly abandoned upstream, and since an RFC by its maintainer in Gentoo
in Jan 2021, no one has volunteered to step up maintenance or expressed interest in
the uClibc-ng profiles. With this announcement we last-rite the "uclibc"
profiles, which will be removed on 2022-01-01. For parties interested in
an alternative libc, consider moving to musl, which is supported.

Gentoo continues to wholeheartedly support musl and is focusing its
efforts in that area.
