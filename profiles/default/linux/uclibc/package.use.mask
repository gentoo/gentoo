# Fails linking to gettext/libintl for symbol 'libintl_gettext'.
# Is fixable by using 'append-ldflags' from flag-o-matic to force
# -lintl, but that's a QA violation.  Real solution is to use
# 'append-libs', but xfsdump's build system doesn't honor $LIBS.
# So this is the best way for now.  See 570548.
