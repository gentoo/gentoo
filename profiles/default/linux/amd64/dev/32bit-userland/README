IMPORTANT
=========

Here's how to use this profile. Any other use will probably break your installation, so you better follow it closely.

1. Download the latest amd64 stage2 tarball
2. Unpack it to your chroot location and do all the bind mounts
3. Chroot in
4. run `find /usr/lib64 /lib64 -exec touch {} \;'
5. remove the "CHOST=" line from /etc/make.conf
6. change the /etc/make.profile link to this profile
7. run `emerge -e world'

Dependencies might not always be quite correct. Don't use this profile for anything else then creating emul-libs.
