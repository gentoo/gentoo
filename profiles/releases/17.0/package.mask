# In the 17.0 profiles we assume that our system compiler uses C++14
# or later as default language setting. This means it has to be at
# least GCC 6. If you need an older compiler for specific purposes,
# feel free to unmask it, however, using it for normal emerging of
# packages is neither recommended nor supported in any way.
