# Masking selective games-*, www-apps/*, net-proxy/* packages because:
# 1) It is unclear if there are any users
# 2) We would like to NOT migrate packages (to gentoo-x86) if we don't have to.
#
# If this is a package that you would like to see in the tree, please open a bug
# report for inclusion (search first).
# This mask will be lifted in 60 days and the packages will not be supporting
# Gentoo Prefix at that time.
