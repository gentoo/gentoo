# A libgcc_s drop-in replacement, which conflicts with sys-devel/gcc,
# therefore meant only for profiles which can work without GCC being
# present even as a fallback. Since glibc can't be built with clang,
# it's possible only on musl/llvm profiles. If that ever changes, we
# can move this unmask to all llvm profiles.
