# Note about LIBDIR_*:
#
# Unlike riscv profiles, LoongArch so far has not defined exact multilib
# layouts for non-multiarch (i.e. non-Debian-derived) systems; also the ABIs
# other than LP64D are underdeveloped and likely unusable. So here we only
# give definitions for lp64d.
#
# Should any official spec be revised such that a multilib layout is given,
# definitions here should be updated to stay compliant.
