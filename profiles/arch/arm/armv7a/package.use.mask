# jsc JIT compilation is supported only on amd64/arm/x86 and their prefixes, so
# it's masked in base profile and unmasked here (bug #396313). Only in arm7 profile
# because webkit-gtk only reliable tests webkit-gtk on this and JIT support is likely
# to break in several ways on every version bump on non-arm7 (#523400)
