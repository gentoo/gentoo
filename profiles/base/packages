# Gentoo Base Profile

# NOTE: THIS IS THE BASE PROFILE FOR *ANY* GENTOO BASED OPERATING SYSTEM.
# NO MODIFICATIONS MAY BE MADE TO THIS FILE WITHOUT PRIOR DISCUSSION.  IF
# YOU ARE CREATING A NEW PROFILE, YOU SIMPLY NEED TO INHERIT THIS BASE
# PROFILE IN YOUR PROFILE DIRECTORY'S "parent" FILE.


# OK, you're staring at this file and you have no idea what these stars are
# for.  Here's the scoop.  An initial "*" marks a package that is part of
# the official BASE system profile.  If there is a "*" then `emerge system`
# will use the line in its calculations of what should be installed for the
# base profile.  Lines without a "*" prefix will be ignored for profile
# system calculations.

# Please note that this file is rarely used as a package inclusion mask
# file, because it affects EVERY SINGLE gentoo profile.   As can be seen,
# we've limited the inclusion mask to a version of portage which supports
# cascaded profiles, but apart from that, there should be no version
# specific information in here. This file serves as a high level description
# of the minimum set of packages needed for any Gentoo based system.
