# PCH has proven itself to be unreliable and lead to spurious build
# failures. Masking so users aren't exposed to such failures without opting-in.
# Failures aren't always reproducible and implementations are often fragile.
# Please speak to <toolchain@gentoo.org> and/or <qa@gentoo.org> before dropping.
# See e.g. bug #753323, bug #822690.
