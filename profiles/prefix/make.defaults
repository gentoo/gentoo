# Some USE-flags that only die-hards don't want:
# readline:  to have some sane command line editing, e.g. in python
# zlib:      for many things you just want gzip support
# ncurses:   a nice working console drawing library
# ssl:       encrypted connections are a nice feature
USE="readline zlib ncurses ssl"


# In Prefix, aim for Python 3 only, leaving out 2 to avoid unnecessary
# builds
# NOTE: Both are incremental variables: Need to drop obsolete base values.
