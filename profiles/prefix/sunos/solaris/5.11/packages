# Host provided libuuid.so links against libpool.so, which in turn links
# against libxml2.so.  In the latter it looks for SUNW@ symbols which
# our Prefix-provided libxml2.so doesn't have and cause problems, hence
# we need to provide libuuid.so ourselves for packages that use it.
# It's added here, because in previous releases we relied on the
# system-provided libuuid, but now no longer can, and ebuilds can't
# easily make the difference.
