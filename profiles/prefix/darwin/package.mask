# Using FSF GCC on Mac OS X is not supported by Gentoo Prefix.  While
# the FSF GCC compiler is certainly useful, some - if not many -
# packages expect the Apple branch of GCC, and its (sometimes peculiar)
# behaviour.  Do not file bugs for packages that fail to compile with
# FSF GCC, if you have patches, please send them directly to upstream.
