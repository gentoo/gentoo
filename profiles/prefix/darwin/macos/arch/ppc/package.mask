# Apple removed entire PowerPC support from ld in ld64-128.2 (4.3)
# darwin-xtools added back support and allows to be compiled from FSF
# GCC for version ld64-274.2 (8.2.1), so basically 3.2.3 and the xtools
# version 8.2.1 are unmasked for us, allowing a non-gcc-apple path, we
# dropped all versions inbetween, mask the incompatible ones remaining
