# GCC-8.2.0 has a faulty libgcc_s, which causes C++ exceptions not the

# Apple removed entire PowerPC support from ld in ld64-128.2 (4.3)
# a backport of PPC support was kept until compilation with gcc-apple
# was no longer possible since 7.0.
# The only working versions are 3.2 and (patched) 6.3, however the
# latter causes bus errors whilst compiling e.g. GCC
