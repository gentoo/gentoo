# Please be extremely careful not to commit atoms that are not valid, as it can

## Example:

# - Best last rites (removal) practices -
# Include the following info:
# a) reason for masking
# b) date of removal
# c) bug # for the removal (and yes you should have one)

# See GLEP 84 for the full description of the format.

## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # Doesn't work with new libfoo. Upstream dead, gtk-1, smells funny.

#
# Users are free to unmask and keep using, but be warned it is very
# likely to be affected by security issues[2] as NVIDIA does not
# track nor fix these for this branch anymore.
#
# Gentoo will keep it packaged for as long as reasonably possible
# (albeit masked) but no true support will be given nor patches
# for newer kernels. It is recommended to use 6.6.x LTS kernels or
# older (6.6.x will be supported upstream until December 2026,
# and 6.1.x a year further to December 2027).
#
# Major issues will lead to removal without further warning, e.g.
# if no usable kernels left in tree, or if broken with a newer Xorg.
#
# >> It is recommended to switch to nouveau[3] drivers (regardless
#    of its worse performance), or ideally replace the hardware.

# Gentoo's kernel maintainers have decided to discontinue gentoo-sources and
# gentoo-kernel for old kernel LTS branches because of the resources to require
# testing and patching them, combined with changing kernel lifecycles.
#
# The new policy is to support kernels with genpatches for 3 years after their
# release.
#
# Specifically, 4.14/4.19/5.4 have been dropped. See https://www.mpagano.com/blog/?p=315
# and http://www.kroah.com/log/blog/2018/08/24/what-stable-kernel-should-i-use/.
