# When you add an entry to the top of this file, add your name, the date
# in the UTC timezone with a format of YYYY-MM-DD, and an explanation of why
# something is getting masked.
# Please be extremely careful not to commit atoms that are not valid, as it can
# cause large-scale breakage, especially if it ends up in the daily snapshot.
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # Masking  these versions until we can get the
## # v4l stuff to work properly again
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5-r1
#
# - Best last rites (removal) practices -
# Include the following info:
# a) reason for masking
# b) bug # for the removal (and yes you should have one)
# c) date of removal (either the date or "in x days")
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # Masked for removal in 30 days.  Doesn't work
## # with new libfoo. Upstream dead, gtk-1, smells
## # funny. (bug #987654)

# Rarely used package with very high maintenance cost.  Hacky, requires
