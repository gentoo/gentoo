# When you add an entry to the top of this file, add your name, the date
# in the UTC timezone, and an explanation of why something is getting masked.
# Please be extremely careful not to commit atoms that are not valid, as it can
# cause large-scale breakage, especially if it ends up in the daily snapshot.
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # Masking  these versions until we can get the
## # v4l stuff to work properly again
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5-r1
#
# - Best last rites (removal) practices -
# Include the following info:
# a) reason for masking
# b) bug # for the removal (and yes you should have one)
# c) date of removal (either the date or "in x days")
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # Masked for removal in 30 days.  Doesn't work
## # with new libfoo. Upstream dead, gtk-1, smells
## # funny. (bug #987654)

# A thin wrapper to run pytest via setup.py that must not be used
# in Gentoo packages.  Calling 'setup.py test' is deprecated upstream
# anyway.  Just call 'pytest' directly.  The last revdep is last rited.

# Python 2 only.
#
# Relax involves implementation conflicts between dependencies.  Even
# if you can get past them, it requires Numdifftools, and...
#
# Numdifftools fails with modern versions of setuptools, most likely
# because it uses pyscaffold that is broken.  There are newer versions
# that removed pyscaffold support but they have new dependencies that
# do not support py2 and porting them back is just not worth the effort.
# Its only revdep is relax.
#
# Pyscaffold is just broken and required only by old versions
# of Numdifftools.

# Removal in 30 days.  Bug #704032.

# Any version above 5.100.138 breaks b43 driver in various ways.
# Also, b43 wiki page says to use 5.100.138. Bug #541080.

# These old versions of toolchain packages (binutils, gcc, glibc) are no
# longer officially supported and are not suitable for general use. Using
# these packages can result in build failures (and possible breakage) for
# many packages, and may leave your system vulnerable to known security
# exploits.
# If you still use one of these old toolchain packages, please upgrade (and
# switch the compiler / the binutils) ASAP. If you need them for a specific
# (isolated) use case, feel free to unmask them on your system.
