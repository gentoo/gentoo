# When you add an entry to the top of this file, add your name, the date
# in the UTC timezone with a format of YYYY-MM-DD, and an explanation of why
# something is getting masked.
# Please be extremely careful not to commit atoms that are not valid, as it can
# cause large-scale breakage, especially if it ends up in the daily snapshot.
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # Masking  these versions until we can get the
## # v4l stuff to work properly again
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5-r1
#
# - Best last rites (removal) practices -
# Include the following info:
# a) reason for masking
# b) bug # for the removal (and yes you should have one)
# c) date of removal (either the date or "in x days")
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # Masked for removal in 30 days.  Doesn't work
## # with new libfoo. Upstream dead, gtk-1, smells
## # funny. (bug #987654)

# to mirror them or not. A convoluted and fragile process has been
# required to detect new modules and versions, and the request for a
# Repology-friendly upstream endpoint appears to have stalled.
# Please switch to managing SWORD modules on a per-user basis, using
# tools bundled with app-text/sword (see e.g.
# https://wiki.crosswire.org/SWORD_Module_Source_Discovery_and_Module_Updating)
# or appropriate functionality in GUI front-end software.

# Mostly obsoleted by the better maintained net-misc/yt-dlp, please
# migrate. If had USE=yt-dlp enabled (default) then was likely already
# using through its youtube-dl compatibility wrapper and this will
# change nothing beside needing to ensure that it is not depcleaned.
#
# Upstream is mostly focusing on compatibility and old python support,
# still uses deprecated Nose for tests, and has not seen a new release
# to deploy fixes in a long time despite major issues (e.g. throttling).
#
# Been kept due to some packages lacking compatibility with yt-dlp's
