# Users are free to unmask and keep using, but be warned it is very

#
# Gentoo will keep it packaged for as long as reasonably possible

# Major issues will lead to removal without further warning, e.g.

# Specifically, 4.14/4.19/5.4 have been dropped. See https://www.mpagano.com/blog/?p=315

# Ionen Wolkens <ionen@gentoo.org> (2023-03-30)
# NVIDIA dropped support for the 390.xx branch in December 2022[1].
#
# Users are free to unmask and keep using, but be warned it is very
# likely to be affected by security issues as NVIDIA does not track
# nor fix these for this branch anymore.
#
# Gentoo will keep it packaged for as long as reasonably possible
# (albeit masked) but no true support will be given nor patches
# for newer kernels. It is recommended to use 6.1.x LTS kernels or
# older (6.1.x will be supported upstream until December 2027).
#
# Major issues will lead to removal without further warning, e.g.
# if no usable kernels left in tree, or if broken with a newer Xorg.
#
# >> It is recommended to switch to nouveau[2] drivers (regardless
#    of its worse performance), or ideally replace the hardware.

# These old versions of toolchain packages (binutils, gcc, glibc) are no
# longer officially supported and are not suitable for general use. Using
# these packages can result in build failures (and possible breakage) for
# many packages, and may leave your system vulnerable to known security
# exploits.
# If you still use one of these old toolchain packages, please upgrade (and
# switch the compiler / the binutils) ASAP. If you need them for a specific
# (isolated) use case, feel free to unmask them on your system.
