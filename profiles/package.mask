# When you add an entry to the top of this file, add your name, the date, and
# an explanation of why something is getting masked. Please be extremely
# careful not to commit atoms that are not valid, as it can cause large-scale
# breakage, especially if it ends up in the daily snapshot.
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (28 Jun 2012)
## # Masking  these versions until we can get the
## # v4l stuff to work properly again
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5-r1
#
# - Best last rites (removal) practices -
# Include the following info:
# a) reason for masking
# b) bug # for the removal (and yes you should have one)
# c) date of removal (either the date or "in x days")
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (23 May 2015)
## # Masked for removal in 30 days.  Doesn't work
## # with new libfoo. Upstream dead, gtk-1, smells
## # funny. (bug #987654)

# gnome-extra/polkit-gnome is the "GTK+ polkit agent" and has no extra
# dependencies that installing lxde-base/lxpolkit would solve, thus
# the only motivation for creation of lxpolkit was to drop the word
# 'gnome' from the package's name. The packages are near identical
# by the outlook, determined by the used GTK+ theme.
#
# Raise yourself above the word 'gnome' and install the de facto GTK+ agent:
# emerge -C lxpolkit
# emerge -1 polkit-gnome
#
# Removal will happen at later date, but since there is no hurry, give it
# until rest of the year.
