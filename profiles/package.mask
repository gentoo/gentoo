# Please be extremely careful not to commit atoms that are not valid, as it can

## Example:

# - Best last rites (removal) practices -

# b) date of removal
# c) bug # for the removal (and yes you should have one)

## Example:

## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # Doesn't work with new libfoo. Upstream dead, gtk-1, smells funny.

#
# Specifically, 4.14/4.19/5.4 have been dropped. See https://www.mpagano.com/blog/?p=315
