# When you add an entry to the top of this file, add your name, the date

# Please be extremely careful not to commit atoms that are not valid, as it can
# cause large-scale breakage, especially if it ends up in the daily snapshot.
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # Masking  these versions until we can get the
## # v4l stuff to work properly again
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5

#
# - Best last rites (removal) practices -
# Include the following info:
# a) reason for masking
# b) bug # for the removal (and yes you should have one)
# c) date of removal (either the date or "in x days")
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # Masked for removal in 30 days.  Doesn't work
## # with new libfoo. Upstream dead, gtk-1, smells
## # funny. (bug #987654)

# These packages are mid-profile Python 2-only dependencies
# of dev-python/pillow.  Since the last Pillow version to support
# Python 2 contains a number of unresolved vulnerabilities, these
# packages and old package versions are queued for removal.
#
# In more detail:
# - pyxplot has been last released in 2012
# - pkpgcounter has been last released in 2007, and has seen only a few
#   commits since 2009
# - scipy has removed py2 support in 1.4 (py2 target in the old version
#   is masked in profiles/base/package.use.mask)
#
# This list does not include two high-profile packages:
# - app-office/scribus whose py3 version is being currently stabilized
# - media-tv/kodi which has no py3 version at the moment
