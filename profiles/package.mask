# When you add an entry to the top of this file, add your name, the date
# in the UTC timezone with a format of YYYY-MM-DD, and an explanation of why
# something is getting masked.
# Please be extremely careful not to commit atoms that are not valid, as it can
# cause large-scale breakage, especially if it ends up in the daily snapshot.
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # Masking  these versions until we can get the
## # v4l stuff to work properly again
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5-r1
#
# - Best last rites (removal) practices -
# Include the following info:
# a) reason for masking
# b) bug # for the removal (and yes you should have one)
# c) date of removal (either the date or "in x days")
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # Masked for removal in 30 days.  Doesn't work
## # with new libfoo. Upstream dead, gtk-1, smells
## # funny. (bug #987654)

# NVIDIA dropped support for the 470.xx branch in September 2024[1].
#
# Users are free to unmask and keep using, but be warned it is very
# likely to be affected by security issues[2] as NVIDIA does not
# track nor fix these for this branch anymore.
#
# Gentoo will keep it packaged for as long as reasonably possible
# (albeit masked) but no true support will be given nor patches
# for newer kernels. It is recommended to use 6.6.x LTS kernels or
# older (6.6.x will be supported upstream until December 2026,
# and 6.1.x a year further to December 2027).
#
# Major issues will lead to removal without further warning, e.g.
# if no usable kernels left in tree, or if broken with a newer Xorg.
#
# >> It is recommended to switch to nouveau[3] drivers (regardless
#    of its worse performance), or ideally replace the hardware.

# Gentoo's kernel maintainers have decided to discontinue gentoo-sources and
# gentoo-kernel for old kernel LTS branches because of the resources to require
# testing and patching them, combined with changing kernel lifecycles.
#
# The new policy is to support kernels with genpatches for 3 years after their
# release.
#
# Specifically, 4.14/4.19/5.4 have been dropped. See https://www.mpagano.com/blog/?p=315
# and http://www.kroah.com/log/blog/2018/08/24/what-stable-kernel-should-i-use/.
#
# sys-kernel/vanilla-sources will continue to be provided for all branches
# until they reach formal upstream EOL.

# Ionen Wolkens <ionen@gentoo.org> (2023-03-30)
# NVIDIA dropped support for the 390.xx branch in December 2022[1].
#
# Users are free to unmask and keep using, but be warned it is very
# likely to be affected by security issues as NVIDIA does not track
# nor fix these for this branch anymore.
#
# Gentoo will keep it packaged for as long as reasonably possible
# (albeit masked) but no true support will be given nor patches
# for newer kernels. It is recommended to use 6.1.x LTS kernels or
# older (6.1.x will be supported upstream until December 2027).
#
# Major issues will lead to removal without further warning, e.g.
# if no usable kernels left in tree, or if broken with a newer Xorg.
#
# >> It is recommended to switch to nouveau[2] drivers (regardless
#    of its worse performance), or ideally replace the hardware.

# longer officially supported and are not suitable for general use. Using
# these packages can result in build failures (and possible breakage) for
# many packages, and may leave your system vulnerable to known security
# exploits.
# If you still use one of these old toolchain packages, please upgrade (and
# switch the compiler / the binutils) ASAP. If you need them for a specific
# (isolated) use case, feel free to unmask them on your system.
