# Please be extremely careful not to commit atoms that are not valid, as it can

## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)

## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5

#
# - Best last rites (removal) practices -
# Include the following info:
# a) reason for masking
# b) bug # for the removal (and yes you should have one)
# c) date of removal (either the date or "in x days")
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (2019-07-01)
## # Masked for removal in 30 days.  Doesn't work
## # with new libfoo. Upstream dead, gtk-1, smells

#
# Gentoo will keep it packaged for as long as reasonably possible
# (albeit masked) but no true support will be given nor patches
# for newer kernels. It is recommended to use 6.1.x LTS kernels or
# older (6.1.x will be supported until at least December 2026).
#
# Major issues will lead to removal without further warning, e.g.
# if no usable kernels left in tree, or if broken with a newer Xorg.

# >> It is recommended to switch to nouveau[2] drivers (regardless
#    of its worse performance), or ideally replace the hardware.

# These old versions of toolchain packages (binutils, gcc, glibc) are no
# longer officially supported and are not suitable for general use. Using
# these packages can result in build failures (and possible breakage) for
# many packages, and may leave your system vulnerable to known security
# exploits.
# If you still use one of these old toolchain packages, please upgrade (and
# switch the compiler / the binutils) ASAP. If you need them for a specific
# (isolated) use case, feel free to unmask them on your system.
