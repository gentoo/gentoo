# When you add an entry to the top of this file, add your name, the date, and
# an explanation of why something is getting masked. Please be extremely
# careful not to commit atoms that are not valid, as it can cause large-scale
# breakage, especially if it ends up in the daily snapshot.
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (28 Jun 2012)
## # Masking  these versions until we can get the
## # v4l stuff to work properly again
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5-r1
#
# - Best last rites (removal) practices -
# Include the following info:
# a) reason for masking
# b) bug # for the removal (and yes you should have one)
# c) date of removal (either the date or "in x days")
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (23 May 2015)
## # Masked for removal in 30 days.  Doesn't work
## # with new libfoo. Upstream dead, gtk-1, smells
## # funny. (bug #987654)

# This is continued by Oracle Corporation, which has acquired Sun Microsystems
# in early 2010; as per https://en.wikipedia.gentoo.org/wiki/Sun_acquisition_by_Oracle
#
# Users are suggested to upgrade to one of the newer Oracle packages like
# dev-java/oracle-jdk-bin or dev-java/oracle-jre-bin or choose another
# alternative we provide; eg. the IBM JDK/JRE or the open source IcedTea.
#
# Most of these packages provide a jce USE flag for those whom need the
# Java Cryptographic Extension Unlimited Strength Policy USE flag; whether that
# works depends from VM to VM, it seems to work for most except for the IBM VMs.
