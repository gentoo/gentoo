  <longdescription>
    Bazelisk is a wrapper for Bazel written in Go. It automatically picks a
    good version of Bazel given your current working directory, downloads it
    from the official server (if required) and then transparently passes
    through all command-line arguments to the real Bazel binary. You can call
    it just like you would call Bazel.
