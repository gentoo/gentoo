Gentoo GNU/Linux specific notes for ECL
---------------------------------------

This is the README.Gentoo file from /usr/share/doc/@PF@/ directory.

  * The Gentoo port includes a patch to ECL's installed header file (ech.h) so
    that TRUE and FALSE are not redefined if they're already included from
    elsewhere. This makes it easier to use ECL with other software which defines
    those C preprocesser symbols (eg. glib-2.0).

If you encounter any problems or have suggestions, use http://bugs.gentoo.org.
Please don't bother the upstream authors unless you are absolutely certain it is
not Gentoo-related.
