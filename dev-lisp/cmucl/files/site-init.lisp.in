Welcome to the Gentoo GNU/Linux port of CMUCL.

The CMUCL REPL does not have GNU Readline-like support, however
you may wish to install rlwap (see: app-misc/rlwrap) to achieve
the same effect.

If you think you found a bug, please use http://bugs.gentoo.org/

Read the documentation in /usr/share/doc/@PF@.

\(quit)            exit Lisp
\(describe 'foo)   gives information about foo
\(inspect '*foo*)  interactively inspects *foo*
\(apropos \"foo\") briefly describe all symbols which match \"foo\"
