CMUCL is a free implementation of the Common Lisp programming language
which runs on most major Unix platforms. It mainly conforms to the
ANSI Common Lisp standard. Here is a summary of its main features:

 * a sophisticated native-code compiler which is capable of powerful
   type inferences, and generates code competitive in speed with C
   compilers.

 * generational garbage collection and multiprocessing capability on
   the x86 ports.

 * a foreign function interface which allows interfacing with C code
   and system libraries, including shared libraries on most platforms,
   and direct access to Unix system calls.

 * support for interprocess communication and remote procedure calls.

 * an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System, which
   includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol.

 * a graphical source-level debugger using a Motif interface, and a
   code profiler.
