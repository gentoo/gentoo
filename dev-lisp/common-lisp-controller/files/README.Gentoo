* Common Lisp Controller 4.x and 5.x

With version 4.x and 5.x of the Debian Common Lisp Controller, the
design of the controller was simplified so that source was compiled
into /var/cache/, per user, on demand (ie. when you evaluate (require
:foo) at the REPL).

* Common Lisp Controller 3.x 

** IMPORTANT

The Common Lisp Controller (CLC) in Gentoo GNU/Linux is a modified
version of the original CLC sources from the Debian Project.  Do not
send bug reports to the Debian Project -- always send bug reports to
http://bugs.gentoo.org.

** NOTES

If you are used to the CLC in Debian, please note that the Gentoo CLC
does not require an Internet super-server such as inetd or xinetd in
order to function.  The original CLC implementation's clc-send-command
has been replaced with a shell script which implements the same
interface, but bypasses clc-build-daemon entirely.
