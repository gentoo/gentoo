CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation. It mostly supports the Lisp
described in the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  It includes an
interpreter, a compiler, almost all of CLOS, a foreign language
interface and a socket interface. An X11 interface is available
through CLX and Garnet. Command line editing is provided by readline.
CLISP runs on microcomputers (OS/2, Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP, Amiga
500-4000, Acorn RISC PC) as well as on Unix workstations (GNU/Linux,
BSD, SVR4, Sun4, DEC Alpha OSF, HP-UX, NeXTstep, SGI, AIX, Sun3 and
others) and needs only 2 MB of RAM.  The user interface comes in
German, English, French, Spanish, Dutch and Russian, and can be
changed at run time.
