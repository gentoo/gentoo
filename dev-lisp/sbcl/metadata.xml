	<longdescription>Steel Bank Common Lisp is an open source Common
	Lisp implementation. It provides an integrated native compiler,
	interpreter, and debugger. SBCL is a fork off of the main branch
	of CMUCL. SBCL is distinguished from CMUCL by a greater emphasis
	on maintainability. In particular, the SBCL system can be built
	directly from its source code, so that the output corresponds to
	the source code in a controlled, verifiable way, and arbitrary
	changes can be made to the system without causing bootstrapping
	problems. SBCL also places less emphasis than CMU CL does on new
	non-ANSI extensions, or on backward compatibility with old
	non-ANSI features. Support for native threading on GNU/Linux is
	available for the x86 and amd64 platforms using an NPTL enabled
	GLIBC. SBCL 0.8.17 and later support Unicode.
