		FLEXI-STREAMS implements "virtual" bivalent streams that can be
		layered atop real binary or bivalent streams and that can be used
		to read and write character data in various single- or multi-octet
		encodings which can be changed on the fly. It also supplies
		in-memory binary streams which are similar to string streams.
