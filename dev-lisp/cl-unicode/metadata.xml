		CL-UNICODE is a library which provides Common Lisp implementations
		with knowledge about Unicode characters including their name, their
		general category, the scripts and blocks they belong to, their
		numerical value, and several other properties. It also provides the
		ability to replace the standard syntax for reading Lisp characters
		with one that is Unicode-aware and is used to enhance CL-PPCRE with
		Unicode properties.
