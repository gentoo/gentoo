		Redirect any TCP connection to a SOCKS or HTTPS proxy server Redsocks
		is a daemon running on the local system, that will transparently tunnel
		any TCP connection via a remote SOCKS4, SOCKS5 or HTTP proxy server. It
		uses the system firewall's redirection facility to intercept TCP
		connections, thus the redirection is system-wide, with fine-grained
		control, and does not depend on LD_PRELOAD libraries.

		Redsocks supports tunneling TCP connections and UDP packets. It has
		authentication support for both, SOCKS and HTTP proxies.

		Also included is a small DNS server returning answers with the
		"truncated" flag set for any UDP query, forcing the resolver to use
		TCP.
