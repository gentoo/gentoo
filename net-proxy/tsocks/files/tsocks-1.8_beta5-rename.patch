-validateconf
-validateconf can be used to verify the configuration file. It checks the format
-of the file and also the contents for errors. Having read the file it dumps 
-the configuration to the screen in a formatted, readable manner. This can be 
-extremely useful in debugging problems.

-validateconf can read a configuration file from a location other than the

-Normally validateconf simply dumps the configuration read to the screen (in
-a nicely readable format), however it also has a useful 'test' mode. When
