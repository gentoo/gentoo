<longdescription lang="en">A semi-automated, largely passive web application security audit tool,
		optimized for an accurate and sensitive detection, and automatic
		annotation, of potential problems and security-relevant design patterns
		based on the observation of existing, user-initiated traffic in complex
		web 2.0 environments.
		Detects and prioritizes broad classes of security problems, such as
		dynamic cross-site trust model considerations, script inclusion issues,
		content serving problems, insufficient XSRF and XSS defenses, and much
		more.</longdescription>
