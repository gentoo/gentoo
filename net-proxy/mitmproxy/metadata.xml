		mitmproxy is your swiss-army knife for debugging,
		testing, privacy measurements, and penetration
		testing. It can be used to intercept, inspect, modify
		and replay web traffic such as HTTP/1, HTTP/2,
		WebSockets, or any other SSL/TLS-protected
		protocols. You can prettify and decode a variety of
		message types ranging from HTML to Protobuf, intercept
		specific messages on-the-fly, modify them before they
		reach their destination, and replay them to a client
		or server later on.
