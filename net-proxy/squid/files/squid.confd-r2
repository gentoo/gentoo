# of filedescriptors squid can open.

# Set whether Squid should receive two shutdown signals instead of one. If set to "yes",
# Squid will skip the graceful shutdown step, and will try to immediately close all open
# file descriptors and helpers. This is useful if you experience very long delays when
# shutting down the caching proxy.
