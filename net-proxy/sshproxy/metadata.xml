sshproxy is a pure python implementation of an ssh proxy. It allows users to connect to remote sites without having to remember
or even know the password or key of the remote sites. There are 2 possible scenarios which could possibly interest you.

   Scenario 1: Team mode
If you're in charge of a lot of remote sites, and your company has several administrators to do some remote administration tasks,
then no user will ever need to know the password or key of the servers he administrates. When an employee quits your company,
you just have to delete his entry in the proxy database, and he will never be able to connect to the remote site.

   Scenario 2: Forwarding mode
You want to allow some people to connect through your firewall to a range of server inside your DMZ or LAN, but you don't want to
open one port for each server. What you can do is open the sshproxy port and setup the password database to proxy each
external user to it's own desktop, or create groups of users allowed to connect to your DMZ servers.
