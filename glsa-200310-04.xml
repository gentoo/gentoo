  <title>Apache: buffer overflows and a possible information disclosure</title>
  <synopsis>
    Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in mod_alias and mod_rewrite can allow
    execution of arbitrary code and cause a denial of service, and a bug in the
    way mod_cgid handles CGI redirect paths could result in CGI output going to
    the wrong client.

    The Apache HTTP Server is one of the most popular web servers on the
    Internet.

  <description>
    <p>
    Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in mod_alias and mod_rewrite allow
    attackers who can create or edit configuration files including .htaccess
    files, to cause a denial of service and execute arbitrary code via a regular
    expression containing more than 9 captures, and a bug in the way mod_cgid
    handles CGI redirect paths could result in CGI output going to the wrong
    client when a threaded MPM is used, resulting in an information disclosure.
    </p>

  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    An attacker may cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with the
    privileges of the user that is running apache.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
    net-misc/apache 2.x upgrade:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    # emerge -pv '&gt;=www-servers/apache-2.0.48'
    # emerge '&gt;=www-servers/apache-2.0.48'
    # emerge clean
    # /etc/init.d/apache2 restart</code>
    <p>
    Please remember to update your config files in /etc/apache2 as --datadir has
    been changed to /var/www/localhost.
    </p>
