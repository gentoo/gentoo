nistp224 performs compressed Diffie-Hellman key exchange on the NIST P-224
elliptic curve at record-setting speeds. It includes an easy-to-use C library
and a command-line tool. nistp224 also supports uncompressed Diffie-Hellman key
exchange on the same curve, with 56-byte public keys, at slightly higher speeds.
