eid-mw is Belgian Electronic Identity Card (eID) middleware supplied by the Belgian Federal Government.

With your eID, you can:
- identify yourself when necessary. All you have to do is insert the card in the reader. All your details then appear automatically on the PC screen.
- authenticate yourself. This is a way of checking that you are who you say you are. That can be handy on the internet or to enable your children to chat in safety.
- place a legally binding electronic signature on electronic documents.

These three functions form the basis of the countless applications for your eID. Go to http://welcome-to-e-belgium.be/en/ and check out what can you do with it? and discover all the things you can use the eID for.
