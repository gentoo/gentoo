af_alg implements an OpenSSL engine that uses the AF_ALG functionailty found in
kernel &gt;= 2.6.38 for crypto offload. Be sure to actually check if it's faster,
as for many modern systems, userspace software implementations are actually
faster, as they avoid a kernel context switch. However, on embedded systems and
others with crypto hardware, AF_ALG may be faster.  The homepage has more
details.
