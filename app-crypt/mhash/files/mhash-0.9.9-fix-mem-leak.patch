The package app-crypt/mhash-0.9.9 as well as app-crypt/mhash-0.9.9-r1 are
affected by a bug which causes memory to be leaked during
mhash_restore_state_mem.

In this function/patch, ret->state is allocated towards the beginning and later
on replaced with a new allocated area without freeing the old.  The patch fixes
it.

Patch already submitted upstream, but depending on speed, this may be faster to
patch in a new patchset.
