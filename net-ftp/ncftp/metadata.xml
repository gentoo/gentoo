NcFTP Client (also known as just NcFTP) is a set of FREE application 
programs implementing the File Transfer Protocol (FTP).

The program has been in service on UNIX systems since 1991 and is a 
popular alternative to the FTP program, /usr/bin/ftp. NcFTP offers many 
ease-of-use and performance enhancements over the stock ftp client, and 
runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms as well as operating systems 
such as Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS X.
