<longdescription lang="en">The Pound program is a reverse proxy, load balancer
  and HTTPS front-end for Web server(s). Pound was developed to enable
  distributing the load among several Web-servers and to allow for a convenient
  SSL wrapper for those Web servers that do not offer it natively. Pound is
  distributed under the GPL - no warranty, it's free to use, copy and give away.
