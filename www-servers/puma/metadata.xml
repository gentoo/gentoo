    Puma is a simple, fast, threaded, and highly concurrent HTTP 1.1
    server for Ruby/Rack applications. Puma is intended for use in
    both development and production environments. In order to get the
    best throughput, it is highly recommended that you use a Ruby
    implementation with real threads like Rubinius or JRuby.
