		lighttpd is a secure, fast, compliant and very flexible web-server
		which has been optimized for high-performance environments. It has a very
		low memory footprint compared to other webservers and takes care of cpu-load.
		Its advanced feature-set (FastCGI, CGI, Auth, Output-Compression,
		URL-Rewriting and many more) make lighttpd the perfect webserver-software
		for every server that is suffering load problems.
