	Varnish is an HTTP accelerator. An HTTP accelerator (often called Reverse Proxy)
	is an application that stores (caches) documents that have been requested over
	the HTTP protocol.
	Based on certain criteria the next client requesting the document is either
	given the cached document, or a "fresh" document requested from a backend
	server. The purpose of this is to minimize the requests going to the backend
	server(s) by serving the same document to potentially many users.

	The goal of Varnish is to be a very fast, stable and effective light-weight HTTP
	accelerator daemon, by using modern and effective technologies. Ease of
	managment and good documentation is also a main goal of the project since the
	lack of either one will render Varnish useless.
