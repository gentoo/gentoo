    Kore is a web application platform for writing scalable, concurrent web
    based processes. It is built with a "secure by default" approach. It is
    fully privilege separated while using strong security features at the
    operating system level such as seccomp, pledge, unveil and more. Today Kore
    is used in a variety of applications ranging from high assurance
    cryptographic devices, machine-learning stacks and even in the aerospace
    industry.
