  w3mnav.el is an Emacs add-on that kludges some Info-like navigation
  keys to the w3m Web browser. This functionality was originally part
  of the Scheme support package Quack, and was intended to work with
  the numerous Scheme books that were converted to HTML from LaTeX
  format. It also works with some other HTML pages that have book-like
  "next page" and "previous page" links.
