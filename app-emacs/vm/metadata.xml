<longdescription>
  VM is a mail reader that runs inside GNU Emacs and XEmacs. It was written as
  an alternative to the Emacs RMAIL mail reader. VM is highly configurable and
  easy to use. It supports POP and IMAP for mail retrieval, understands MIME,
  and reads both the standard UNIX mailbox format and the BABYL format used by
  the RMAIL mailer.
