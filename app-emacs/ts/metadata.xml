  <longdescription>
    ts is a date and time library for Emacs. It aims to be more convenient than
    patterns like (string-to-number (format-time-string "%Y")) by providing
    easy accessors, like (ts-year (ts-now)). To improve performance
    (significantly), formatted date parts are computed lazily rather than when
    a timestamp object is instantiated, and the computed parts are then cached
    for later access without recomputing. Behind the scenes, this avoids
    unnecessary (string-to-number (format-time-string... calls, which are
    surprisingly expensive.
