    Eat's name self-explanatory, it stands for "Emulate A Terminal". Eat is a
    terminal emulator. It can run most (if not all) full-screen terminal
    programs, including Emacs. It is pretty fast, more than three times faster
    than Term, despite being implemented entirely in Emacs Lisp. So fast that
    you can comfortably run Emacs inside Eat, or even use your Emacs as a
    terminal multiplexer. It has many features that other Emacs terminal
    emulator still don't have, for example Sixel support, complete mouse
    support, shell integration, etc. It flickers less than other Emacs terminal
    emulator, so you get more performance and a smoother experience.
