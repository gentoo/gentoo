  <longdescription>
    This library provides a linter for the metadata in Emacs Lisp files which
    are intended to be packages. You can integrate it into your build process.
    package-lint detects various issues that may make your package
    uninstallable or unusable for some users, and it warns about significant
    deviations from the Elisp coding conventions, such as non-compliant symbol
    naming, and use of reserved keybindings. Among other community uses,
    package-lint is a prerequisite for submission of packages to MELPA.
    package-lint can be used standalone, but see also the flycheck-package and
    package-lint-flymake packages, which both use package-lint to conveniently
    display packaging errors directly in the buffer while writing elisp
    packages.
