  Bongo is a buffer-oriented media player for Emacs, contemporary with and
  comparable to <pkg>app-emacs/emms</pkg>.

  Notable features of Bongo include
  * separate playlist and library buffers (each of which you may have any
    number — even zero of both is okay if you don’t need playlist
    functionality),
  * hierarchical buffers with collapsable sections for each artist and album,
  * familiar Emacs bindings for editing Bongo buffers (edit playlists much
    like you would regular text), 
  * a nice visual seeking interface doubling as a progress meter (hit ‘s’),
  * a visual audio volume control (<pkg>app-emacs/volume</pkg>, which is
    actually a stand-alone package),
  * built-in support for playing and retrieving information about audio CDs,
  * built-in support for submitting information to Last.fm using
    ‘lastfmsubmitd’,
  * the ability to perform arbitrary actions (stopping playback is a simple
    example) once playback reaches certain points in the playlist, using
    so-called “action tracks”,
  * an XMMS-like keymap for XMMS refugees,
  * zero-configuration, out-of-the-box rock’n’roll action.

  Bongo currently comes with backends for VLC, mpg321, ogg123, speexdec,
  TiMidity and MikMod. All backends support pausing and resuming, but only VLC
  and mpg321 support interactive seeking. Defining your own non-interactive
  backends is very simple.
