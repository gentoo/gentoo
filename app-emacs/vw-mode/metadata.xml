    Major mode for editing programming language descriptions in the
    style used by the Algol 68 Revised Report.  The syntax of the language
    is expressed formally using a van-Wijngaarden grammar, also known as
    VW-grammars or two-level grammars. These grammars have the same
    expression power than a Turing machine, and can therefore cover much
    more than the usual BNF-style representations which are restricted to
    what can be expressed by context-free grammars.  Pragmatic annotations
    and cross-references complement the grammar rules, which are organized
    in numbered sections.
