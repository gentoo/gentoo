Emacs Muse is an authoring and publishing environment for Emacs. It
simplifies the process of writing documents and publishing them to
various output formats.

Muse consists of two main parts: an enhanced text-mode for authoring
documents and navigating within Muse projects, and a set of publishing
styles for generating different kinds of output.

This idea is not in any way new. Numerous systems exist - even one
other for Emacs itself (Bhl Mode). What Muse adds to the picture is a
more modular environment, with a rather simple core, in which "styles"
are derived from to create new styles. Much of Muse's overall
functionality is optional. For example, you can use the publisher
without the major-mode, or the mode without doing any publishing; or
if you don't load the Texinfo or LaTeX modules, those styles won't be
available.

The Muse codebase is a departure from emacs-wiki.el version 2.44. The
code has been restructured and rewritten, especially its publishing
functions. The focus in this revision is on the authoring and
publishing aspects, and the "wikiness" has been removed as a default
behavior (available as the optional module muse-wiki.el). CamelCase
words are no longer special by default.
