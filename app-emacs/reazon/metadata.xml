  <longdescription>
    Reazon is an Emacs implementation of miniKanren, a small domain-specific
    logic programming language. Whereas languages like Elisp deal with
    functions that take inputs and yield outputs, miniKanren deals with sets of
    values that satisfy relations. Every function is a relation, but not vice
    versa, since a relation might include the output of a function but not its
    inputs. In such a case, miniKanren would attempt to find inputs yielding
    the output, effectively running the function backwards.
