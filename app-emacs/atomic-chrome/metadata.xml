  This is the Emacs version of Atomic Chrome which is an extension
  for the Google Chrome browser that allows you to edit text areas
  of the browser in Emacs. The input on Emacs is reflected to the
  browser instantly and continuously. You can use both the browser
  and Emacs at the same time. They are updated to the same content
  bi-directionally.

  Atomic Chrome for Emacs is also compatible with Firefox via the
  GhostText browser extension.
