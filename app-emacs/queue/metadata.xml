    Provides queues can be used both as a first-in last-out (FILO) and
    as a first-in first-out (FIFO) stack, i.e. elements can be added to
    the front or back of the queue, and can be removed from the
    front. (This type of data structure is sometimes called an
    "output-restricted deque".)
