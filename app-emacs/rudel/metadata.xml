  Rudel is collaborative editing environment for GNU Emacs. Its purpose
  is tod share buffers with other users in order to edit the contents
  of those buffers collaboratively. Rudel supports multiple backends to
  enable communication with other collaborative editors using different
  protocols, though currently Obby (for use with the Gobby editor) is
  the only fully-functional one.
