    Embark makes it easy to choose a command to run based on what is near
    point, both during a minibuffer completion session (in a way familiar to
    Helm or Counsel users) and in normal buffers. Bind the command embark-act
    to a key and it acts like prefix-key for a keymap of actions (commands)
    relevant to the target around point. With point on an URL in a buffer you
    can open the URL in a browser or eww or download the file it points to. If
    while switching buffers you spot an old one, you can kill it right there
    and continue to select another. Embark comes preconfigured with over a
    hundred actions for common types of targets such as files, buffers,
    identifiers, s-expressions, sentences; and it is easy to add more actions
    and more target types. Embark can also collect all the candidates in a
    minibuffer to an occur-like buffer or export them to a buffer in a
    major-mode specific to the type of candidates, such as dired for a set of
    files, ibuffer for a set of buffers, or customize for a set of variables.
