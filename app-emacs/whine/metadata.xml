<longdescription>
  Whine modifies a lot of the commands bound to the main Emacs keys, like SPC
  and C-f and RET and C-x C-s. They still do the same things they did before,
  but they whine about it, printing messages which do not in general have
  anything to do with reality. The main lossage is C-l, which refreshes the
  screen and then whines about it so that you can't get a clear message line.
