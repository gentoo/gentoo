  <longdescription>
    macrostep is an Emacs minor mode for interactively stepping through the
    expansion of macros in Emacs Lisp source code. It lets you see exactly what
    happens at each step of the expansion process by pretty-printing the
    expanded forms inline in the source buffer, which is temporarily read-only
    while macro expansions are visible. You can expand and collapse macro forms
    one step at a time, and evaluate or instrument the expansions for debugging
    with Edebug as normal. Single-stepping through the expansion is
    particularly useful for debugging macros that expand into another macro
    form. These can be difficult to debug with Emacsâ€™ built-in macroexpand,
    which continues expansion until the top-level form is no longer a macro
    call.
