  ECB stands for "Emacs Code Browser". While Emacs already has good editing
  support for many modes, its browsing support is somewhat lacking. That's
  where ECB comes in: it displays a number of informational windows that allow
  for easy source code navigation and overview.

  The informational windows can contain:

    * A directory tree,
    * a list of source files in the current directory,
    * a list of functions/classes/methods/... in the current file, (ECB uses
      the Semantic Bovinator, or Imenu, or etags, for getting this list so all
      languages supported by any of these tools are automatically supported by
      ECB too),
    * a history of recently visited files,
    * the Speedbar and
    * output from compilation (the compilation window) and other modes like
      help, grep etc. or whatever a user defines to be displayed in this
      window.

  As an added bonus, ECB makes sure to keep these informational windows
  visible, even when you use C-x 1 and similar commands.

  It goes without saying that you can configure the layout, ie. which
  informational windows should be displayed where. ECB comes with a number of
  ready-made window layouts to choose from.
