<longdescription>
  This package provides several shortcut commands for visiting or
  inserting files without having to specify them by their complete name.
  For example, you can visit programs in your exec-path (some of which
  may be humanly-readable shell scripts or config files), or anything
  else which is quickly locatable via a prebuilt database or path list.
  Completion is also available for many commands.
