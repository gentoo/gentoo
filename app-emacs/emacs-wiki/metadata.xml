  Emacs-wiki allows you to create a wiki on your local system and
  export HTML pages.

  Emacs-wiki has many uses. It has been used to organize links. It can
  make web page maintenance and design a lot easier. It is used as the
  back-end of Planner. You can store and link together various bits of
  information in a coherent manner. A weblog of sorts can be made with
  it, but RSS syndication is not supported.

  Emacs-wiki is not a real wiki in its basic configuration, because
  users from the web cannot edit the pages unless you use
  emacs-wiki-httpd.el.

  Emacs-wiki does not allow you to edit the pages of TheEmacsWiki.
