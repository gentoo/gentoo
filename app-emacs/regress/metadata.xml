  This module provides support for writing and executing regression tests
  for Emacs Lisp code.

  This module makes it easy for Emacs lisp programmers to write
  complete, well-documented regression tests and to run them often
  during the developement and enhancement processes.

  Here's the idea:
    1. The programmer puts one or more test suites directly in the lisp
       file, wrapped inside an "eval-when-compile" special form.  This
       causes the test suites to be available when .el file is loaded
       (or when the buffer is evaluated), but not when the .elc file is
       loaded.

    2. The programmer runs the tests in one of two ways:
         a. Interactively, with the M-x regress command.
         b. Automatically, every time the file is evaluated, by putting
            a small bit of code at the end of the file.

    3. If there are any regressions, a report is produced detailing the
       problems.
