    Sesman provides facilities for session management and interactive session
    association with the current contexts (e.g. project, directory, buffers).
    While sesman can be used to manage arbitrary "sessions", it primary targets
    the Emacs based IDEs (CIDER, ESS, Geiser, Robe, SLIME etc.) For Emacs based
    IDEs, session are commonly composed of one or more physical processes
    (sub-processes, sockets, websockets etc). For example in the current
    implementation of CIDER a session would be composed of one or more sesman
    connections (Clojure or ClojureScript). Each CIDER connection consists of
    user REPL buffer and two sub-processes, one for user eval communication and
    another for tooling (completion, inspector etc).
