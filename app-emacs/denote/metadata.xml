    Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs. It is based on the idea that
    notes should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming scheme. The
    file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is about, without
    reference to any other metadata. Denote basically streamlines the creation
    of such files while providing facilities to link between them.
