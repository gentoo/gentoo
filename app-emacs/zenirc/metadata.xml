  ZenIRC is a full-featured scriptable IRC client for the EMACS text editor.
  It runs on any OS where EMACS supports sockets. It is compatible with GNU
  Emacs 18.59 and above, and all versions of XEmacs. ZenIRC is Free Software.
  ZenIRC supports multiple irc sessions in separate buffers. There is a
  rudimentary command syntax for use within those sessions, but most user
  preferences and extensions are written and configured in emacs-lisp. Most
  features are implemented via module extensions. For example, DCC (Direct
  Client-to-Client) can be enabled at the user's option.
