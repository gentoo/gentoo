    SLY is Sylvester the Cat's Common Lisp IDE for Emacs.
    SLY is a fork of SLIME. All SLIME's familar features (debugger, inspector,
    xref, etc...) are still available, with improved overall UX. SLY's
    highlights are:
    A full-featured REPL based on Emacs's comint.el. Everything can be copied
    to the REPL;
    Stickers, or live code annotations that record values as code traverses
    them.
    Flex-style completion out-of-the-box, using Emacs's completion API.
    Company, Helm, and other supported natively, no plugin required;
    An interactive Trace Dialog;
    Cleanly ASDF-loaded by default, including contribs, enabled out-of-the-box;
    Multiple inspectors and multiple REPLs;
    "Presentations" replaced by interactive backreferences which highlight the
    object and remain stable throughout the REPL session;
    Support for NAMED-READTABLES, macrostep.el and quicklisp.
    A portable, annotation-based stepper in early but functional prototype
    stage.
