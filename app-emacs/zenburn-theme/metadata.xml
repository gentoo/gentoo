  Zenburn for Emacs is a direct port of the popular Zenburn theme
  for vim, developed by Jani Nurminen. It's my personal belief (and that
  of its many users I presume) that it's one of the best low contrast
  color themes out there and that it is exceptionally easy on the eyes.
  Zenburn is a low-contrast color theme. It's easy for your eyes and
  designed to keep you in the zone for long programming sessions.
