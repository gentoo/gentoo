<longdescription>
  This library makes it possible to reliably use the Emacsclient as
  the $EDITOR of child processes. It makes sure that they know how to
  call home. For remote processes a substitute is provided, which
  communicates with Emacs on standard output/input instead of using a
  socket as the Emacsclient does.
