  <longdescription>
    A search package based on the ripgrep command line tool. It allows you to
    interactively create searches, doing automatic searches based on the
    editing context, refining and modifying search results and much more. It is
    also highly configurable to be able to fit different users' needs. If you
    are used to built-in Emacs rgrep command, transitioning to rg should be
    simple. rg provides a lot of extra features but the basics are similar. The
    big benefit of using ripgrep instead of grep as a backend is speed.
    Especially when searching large source code repositories where ripgrep
    really shines.
