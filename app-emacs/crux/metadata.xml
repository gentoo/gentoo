    A Collection of Ridiculously Useful eXtensions for Emacs. crux bundles many
    useful interactive commands to enhance your overall Emacs experience. Most
    of the crux commands are related to the editing experience, but there are
    also a bunch of utility commands that are just very useful to have (e.g.
    crux-open-with and crux-reopen-as-root). Many of the functions in crux
    started life as blog posts on Emacs Redux, then were included in Emacs
    Prelude, before finally being extracted to crux. You can see a full list of
    blog posts on functions in crux on the tags page.
