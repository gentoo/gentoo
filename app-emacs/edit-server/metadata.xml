<longdescription>
  Edit with Emacs is an addon for webextension compatible browsers
  like Google's Chrome(ium), Opera or Firefox that allows you to edit
  text areas on your browser in a more full featured editor. It does
  this in conjunction with an "Edit Server" which services requests by
  the browser. This is because extensions cannot spawn new processes
  as a security measure. 

  The extension packages a native elisp version that can be run inside
  GNU Emacs itself.
