  <longdescription>
    plz is an HTTP library for Emacs. It uses curl as a backend, which avoids
    some of the issues with using Emacs's built-in url library. It supports
    both synchronous and asynchronous requests. Its API is intended to be
    simple, natural, and expressive. Its code is intended to be simple and
    well-organized. Every feature is tested against httpbin.
