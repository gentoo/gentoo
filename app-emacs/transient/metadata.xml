<longdescription>
  Taking inspiration from prefix keys and prefix arguments, Transient
  implements a similar abstraction involving a prefix command, infix
  arguments and suffix commands.  We could call this abstraction a
  "transient command", but because it always involves at least two
  commands (a prefix and a suffix) we prefer to call it just a
  "transient".
  
  When the user calls a transient prefix command, then a transient
  (temporary) keymap is activated, which binds the transient's infix
  and suffix commands, and functions that control the transient state
  are added to `pre-command-hook' and `post-command-hook'.  The
  available suffix and infix commands and their state are shown in
  the echo area until the transient is exited by invoking a suffix
  command.
  
  Calling an infix command causes its value to be changed, possibly
  by reading a new value in the minibuffer.
  
  Calling a suffix command usually causes the transient to be exited
  but suffix commands can also be configured to not exit the
  transient state.
