    Tempel is a tiny template package for Emacs, which uses the syntax of the
    Emacs Tempo library. Tempo is an ancient temple of the church of Emacs. It
    is 27 years old, but still in good shape since it successfully resisted
    change over the decades. However it may look a bit dusty here and there.
    Therefore we present Tempel, a new implementation of Tempo with inline
    expansion and integration with recent Emacs facilities. Tempel takes
    advantage of the standard completion-at-point-functions mechanism which is
    used by Emacs for in-buffer completion.
