  SLIME: The Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs.  SLIME is a
  fresh, new Emacs mode for Common Lisp development inspired by existing
  systems such Emacs Lisp and ILISP. Feature highlights include:

    * slime-mode: An Emacs minor-mode to enhance lisp-mode with:
      o Code evaluation, compilation, and macroexpansion.
      o Online documentation (describe, apropos, hyperspec).
      o Definition finding (aka Meta-Point aka M-.).
      o Symbol and package name completion.
      o Automatic macro indentation based on &amp;body.
      o Cross-reference interface (WHO-CALLS, etc).
      o ... and more.

    * SLDB: Common Lisp debugger with an Emacs-based user interface.

    * REPL: The Read-Eval-Print Loop ("top-level") is written in Emacs
      Lisp for tighter integration with Emacs. The REPL also has builtin
      "shortcut" commands similar those of the McCLIM Listener.

    * Compilation notes: SLIME is able to take compiler messages and
      annotate them directly into source buffers.

    * Inspector: Interactive object-inspector in an Emacs buffer.
