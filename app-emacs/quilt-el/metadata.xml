  quilt-el is an Emacs minor mode for quilt. By using this, it becomes easy to
  edit files controlled by quilt. The main features are as follows:
    * Automatically detects files that are in a quilt hierarchy and enables
      itself.
    * Only files in topmost patch can be writable.
    * Some handy shortcut keys of quilt commands.
