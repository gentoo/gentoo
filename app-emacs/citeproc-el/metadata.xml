    citeproc-el is an Emacs Lisp library for rendering citations and
    bibliographies in styles described in the Citation Style Language (CSL), an
    XML-based, open format to describe the formatting of bibliographic
    references (see http://citationstyles.org/ for further information on CSL).
    The library implements most of the CSL 1.0.2 specification, including such
    features as citation disambiguation, cite collapsing and subsequent author
    substitution, and passes more than 70% of the tests in the CSL Test Suite.
    In addition to the standard CSL-JSON data format, citeproc-el has
    rudimentary support for reading bibliographic data from BibTeX, biblatex
    and org-bibtex bibliographies and can produce output in several formats
    including HTML and org-mode markup (see Supported output formats for the
    full list).
