  <longdescription>
    This package provides tools to save and restore frame and window
    configurations in Emacs, including buffers that may not be live anymore. In
    this way, itâ€™s like a lightweight "workspace" manager, allowing you to
    easily restore one or more frames, including their windows, the windows'
    layout, and their buffers.
