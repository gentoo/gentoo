  <longdescription>
    Assess provides additional support for testing Emacs packages. It provides:
    a set of predicates for comparing strings, buffers and file contents,
    explainer functions for all predicates giving useful output, macros for
    creating many temporary buffers at once, and for restoring the buffer list,
    methods for testing indentation, by comparison or "roundtripping", methods
    for testing fontification.
    Assess aims to be a stateless as possible, leaving Emacs unchanged whether
    the tests succeed or fail, with respect to buffers, open files and so on;
    this helps to keep tests independent from each other.
