<longdescription>
  'Remember' is a mode for remembering data. It uses whatever back-end is
  appropriate to record and correlate the data, but its main intention is to
  allow you to express as little structure as possible up front. If you later
  want to express more powerful relationships between your data, or state
  assumptions that were at first too implicit to be recognized, you can
  'study' the data later and rearrange it. But the initial 'just remember
  this' impulse should be as close to simply throwing the data at Emacs as
  possible.
