  chess.el is an Emacs Lisp library and several clients on top of the
  underlying library functionality for performing various activities related
  to the game of chess.

  You can play against an external chess program such as gnuchess, crafty,
  phalanx or sjeng.  All of them are publically available, and chess.el will
  automatically detect which one you have installed, provided they have
  standard executable program names, and are in a located in a directory which
  is part of the PATH.  See the customisable variable `chess-default-engine'.

  You can also play against another human or computer over the internet
  (through a direct Emacs-to-Emacs connection, or on one of the Internet Chess
  Servers like freechess.org or chessclub.com), or even against a very simple
  chess thinking module implemented in pure Emacs Lisp.

  chess.el also provides a mode for editing Portable Game Notation (PGN) files.
