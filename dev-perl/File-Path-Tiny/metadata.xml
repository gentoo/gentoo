  The goal here is simply to provide recursive versions of mkdir() and rmdir() with as little code and overhead as possible.

This module is in no way meant to derogate File::Path and is in no way an endorsement to go out and replace all use of File::Path with File::Path::Tiny.

File::Path is very good at what it does but there's simply a lot happening that we can do without much of the time.</longdescription>
