Starman is a PSGI perl web server that has unique features such as:

High Performance
Uses the fast XS/C HTTP header parser

Preforking
Spawns workers preforked like most high performance UNIX servers do. Starman also reaps dead children and automatically restarts the worker pool.

Signals
Supports HUP for graceful worker restarts, and TTIN/TTOU to dynamically increase or decrease the number of worker processes, as well as QUIT to gracefully shutdown the worker processes.

Superdaemon aware
Supports Server::Starter for hot deploy and graceful restarts.

Multiple interfaces and UNIX Domain Socket support
Able to listen on multiple interfaces including UNIX sockets.

Small memory footprint
Preloading the applications with --preload-app command line option enables copy-on-write friendly memory management. Also, the minimum memory usage Starman requires for the master process is 7MB and children (workers) is less than 3.0MB.

PSGI compatible
Can run any PSGI applications and frameworks

HTTP/1.1 support
Supports chunked requests and responses, keep-alive and pipeline requests.

UNIX only
This server does not support Win32.
