-# FIXME: This is really a hack! Problem: Depending on the build system,
-# we may or may not build and install the XS version.  If the XS version
-# is being built, the directory blib/arch will be populated, if it is
-# not being built, blib/arch will be empty.  Unfortunately, if blib/arch
-# is not empty, *all* library files will be installed in the architecture
-# dependent locations, if it is empty, they will be installed in the
-# architecture independent tree.
-#
-# Unfortunately, ExtUtils::MakeMaker does not take care of uninstalling
-# files from previous installations.  Consequently, we cannot determine
-# which version of the library will be loaded, since this depends on the
-# current value of @INC.
-#
-# The solution does not really make me happy.  The Makefile will be patched,
-# so that instead of ExtUtils::Install a custom module MyInstall.pm will
-# be used.  This custom module overwrites the subroutine that detects
-# whether a directory is empty in ExtUtils::Install, and will lie if that
-# directory happens to be "blib/arch".  This little hack effectively disables 
-# the annoying behavior of ExtUtils::Install (and I sincerely hope that
-# this is portable).
