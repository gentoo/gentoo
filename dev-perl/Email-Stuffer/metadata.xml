Email::Stuffer, as its name suggests, is a fairly casual module used to stuff things into an email and send them. It is a high-level module designed for ease of use when doing a very specific common task, but implemented on top of the light and tolerable Email:: modules.

Email::Stuffer is typically used to build emails and send them in a single statement, as seen in the synopsis. And it is certain only for use when creating and sending emails. As such, it contains no email parsing capability, and little to no modification support.

To re-iterate, this is very much a module for those "slap it together and fire it off" situations, but that still has enough grunt behind the scenes to do things properly.
