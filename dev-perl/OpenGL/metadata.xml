  OpenGL is a Perl module that provides an interface to most of Open Graphics
  Library, API versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. There is full support for the Utility
  Toolkit (GLUT) up to version 3 and provides some additional functionality via
  partial support for the Utility Library (GLU). It also provides functionality
  to use the X Window System (through X11 and GLX) as an alternative to GLUT.
