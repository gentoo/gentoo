  Harminv is a program to solve the problem of harmonic inversion,
  given a discrete-time, finite-length signal that consists of a sum of
  finitely-many sinusoids (possibly exponentially decaying) in a given
  bandwidth, it determines the frequencies, decay constants, amplitudes,
  and phases of those sinusoids.
