  The CERN Program Library is a large collection of general purpose
  libraries and modules maintained and offered in both source and
  object code form on the CERN central computers. Most of these
  programs were developed at CERN and are therefore oriented towards
  the needs of a physics research laboratory that is general
  mathematics, data analysis, detectors simulation, data-handling
  etc... applicable to a wide range of problems.
