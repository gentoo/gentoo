  PYTHIA is a program for the generation of high-energy physics
  events, i.e. for the description of collisions at high energies
  between elementary particles such as e+, e-, p and pbar in various
  combinations. It contains theory and models for a number of physics
  aspects, including hard and soft interactions, parton distributions,
  initial- and final-state parton showers, multiple interactions,
  fragmentation and decay. It is largely based on original research,
  but also borrows many formulae and other knowledge from the
  literature.
