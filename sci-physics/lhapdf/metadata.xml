  Les Houches Parton Density Function (LHAPDF)
  provides a unified and easy to use interface to modern PDF
  sets. It is designed to work not only with individual PDF sets but
  also with the more recent multiple "error" sets. It can be viewed as
  the successor to PDFLIB, incorporating many of the older sets found in
  the latter, including pion and photon PDFs. In LHAPDF the computer
  code and input parameters/grids are separated thus allowing more easy
  updating and no limit to the expansion possibilities. The code and
  data sets can be downloaded together or individually as desired. From
  version 4.1 onwards a configuration script facilitates the
  installation of LHAPDF.
