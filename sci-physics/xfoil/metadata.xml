  XFOIL is an interactive program for the design and analysis of subsonic isolated airfoils.
  It consists of a collection of menu-driven routines which perform various useful functions such as:
    * Viscous (or inviscid) analysis of an existing airfoil
    * Airfoil design and redesign by interactive modification of surface speed distributions
    * Airfoil redesign by interactive modification of geometric parameters
    * Blending of airfoils
    * Writing and reading of airfoil coordinates and polar save files
    * Plotting of geometry, pressure distributions, and multiple polars
