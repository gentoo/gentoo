  The HepMC package is an object oriented event record written in C++
  for High Energy Physics Monte Carlo Generators. Many extensions from
  HEPEVT, the Fortran HEP standard, are supported: the number of entries
  is unlimited, spin density matrices can be stored with each vertex,
  flow patterns (such as color) can be stored and traced, integers
  representing random number generator states can be stored, and an
  arbitrary number of event weights can be included. Particles and
  vertices are kept separate in a graph structure, physically similar to
  a physics event. The added information supports the modularisation of
  event generators. The package has been kept as simple as possible with
  minimal internal/external dependencies. Event information is accessed
  by means of iterators supplied with the package.
