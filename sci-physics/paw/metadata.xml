		PAW is an interactive program providing interactive graphical
		presentation and statistical and mathematical analysis tools. It is
		designed to work on objects familiar to physicists such as histograms,
		event files (Ntuples), vectors, etc.
		The program is linked statically against the CERN libraries on 64-bit
		architectures in order to function properly, as its design is not very
		64-bit clean. Even so, AMD64 is the only 64-bit platform where it
		functions well.
