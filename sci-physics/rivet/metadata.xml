  The Rivet project (Robust Independent Validation of Experiment and
  Theory) is a toolkit for validation of Monte Carlo event
  generators. It provides a large (and ever growing) set of
  experimental analyses useful for MC generator development,
  validation, and tuning, as well as a convenient infrastructure for
  adding your own analyses. Rivet is the most widespread way by which
  analysis code from the LHC and other high-energy collider
  experiments is preserved for comparison to and development of future
  theory models.
