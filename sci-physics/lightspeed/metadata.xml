  <longdescription lang="en">
  Light Speed! is an OpenGL-based program developed to illustrate the
  effects of special relativity on the appearance of moving
  objects. The moving object is, by default, a geometric lattice. 3D
  Studio and LightWave 3D objects may be imported as well. Best of
  all, the simulator is completely interactive, rendering the exotic
  distortions in real-time.
