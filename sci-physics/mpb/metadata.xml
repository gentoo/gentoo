  The MIT Photonic-Bands (MPB) package is a program for computing
  the band structures (dispersion relations) and electromagnetic modes of
  periodic dielectric structures, on both serial and parallel computers. It was
  developed by Steven G. Johnson at MIT in the Joannopoulos Ab Initio Physics
  group.
  This program computes definite-frequency eigenstates of Maxwell's
  equations in periodic dielectric structures for arbitrary wavevectors, using
  fully-vectorial and three-dimensional methods. It is especially
  designed for the study of photonic crystals (a.k.a. photonic
  band-gap materials), but is also applicable to many other problems
  in optics, such as waveguides and resonator systems.
  (For example, it can solve for the modes of waveguides with arbitrary
  cross-sections.)
