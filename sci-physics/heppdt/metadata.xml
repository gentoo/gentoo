  HepPDT contains the fixed data about each particle type. In other
  words, it contains the data that can be found in the Review of
  Particle Properties.
  This data is conceptually split into particle information (e.g. mass)
  and decay information. HepPDT provides a simple set of particle data
  classes. Particle ID translation methods are in a separate HepPID
  library, which is distributed as part of HepPDT.
