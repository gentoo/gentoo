	<longdescription lang="en">GuiLoader is a high-performance and compact GuiXml loader library. This
		library allows GTK+ applications to c reate GUI widgets and objects at
		run-time from GuiXml resource files. GuiLoader is written in C language
		as a GObject subclass and has a trivial language-independent API.
		GuiLoader was designed to be easily wrapped for any language that has
		GTK+ bindings.</longdescription>
