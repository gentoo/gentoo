	Hammer is a parsing library. Like many modern parsing libraries, it 
	provides a parser combinator interface for writing grammars as 
	inline domain-specific languages, but Hammer also provides a variety 
	of parsing backends. It's also bit-oriented rather than 
	character-oriented, making it ideal for parsing binary data such as 
	images, network packets, audio, and executables.
