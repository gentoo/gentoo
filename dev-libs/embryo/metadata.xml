Embryo is primarily a shared library that gives you an API to load and control
interpredted programs compiled into the abstract machine bytecode that it
understands. This abstrac (or virtual) machine is imilar to a real machine
with a CPU, but it is emulated in software. The architecture is simple and is
the same as the abstract machine (AMX) in the
SMALL (http://www.compuphase.com/small.htm) language as it is based
on exactly the same code. Embryo has modified the code for the AMX extensively
and has made it smaller and more portable. It is VERY small. The total size
of the virtual machine code AND header files is less than 2500 lines of code.
It includes the floating point library support by default as well. This makes
it one of the smallest interpreting engines around, and thus makes is very
efficient to use in code.
