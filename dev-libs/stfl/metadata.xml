		STFL is a library which implements a curses-based widget set for text
		terminals.

		The STFL API can be used from C, SPL, Python, Perl and Ruby. Since the
		API is only 14 simple function calls big and there are already generic
		SWIG bindings it is very easy to port STFL to additional scripting
		languages.

		A special language (the Structured Terminal Forms Language) is used to
		describe STFL GUIs. The language is designed to be easy and fast to
		write so an application programmer does not need to spend ages fiddling
		around with the GUI and can concentrate on the more interesting
		programming tasks.
