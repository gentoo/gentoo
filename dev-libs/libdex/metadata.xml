  <longdescription>
    Dex is a library supporting "Deferred Execution" with the explicit
    goal of integrating with GNOME and GTK-based applications.
    It provides primatives for supporting futures in a variety of ways
    with both read-only and writable views. Additionally, integration
    with existing asynchronous-based APIs is provided through the use
    of wrapper promises.
