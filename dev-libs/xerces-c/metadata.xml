  <flag name="iconv">Use iconv (<pkg>virtual/libiconv</pkg>) as message loader
    and transcoder (in general it would be possible to use iconv only as
    message loader and something else like icu or the native method as
    transcoder and vice-versa, but this is a less common case and hard to
    handle)</flag>
  <flag name="threads">Enable threading support through pthread (or other
    libraries on AIX, IRIX, HPUX, Solars). Highly recommended</flag>
