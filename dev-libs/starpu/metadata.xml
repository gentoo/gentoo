<longdescription lang="en">
  StarPU is a runtime system that offers support for heterogeneous
  multicore machines. While many efforts are devoted to design efficient
  computation kernels for those architectures (e.g. to implement BLAS
  kernels on GPUs or on Cell's SPUs), StarPU not only takes care of
  offloading such kernels (and implementing data coherency across
  the machine), but it also makes sure the kernels are executed as
  efficiently as possible.
