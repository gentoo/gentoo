	Serd is a lightweight C library for RDF syntax which supports reading and writing Turtle and NTriples.

	Serd is not intended to be a swiss-army knife of RDF syntax, but rather is suited to resource limited or performance critical applications, or situations where a simple reader/writer with minimal dependencies is ideal (e.g. in LV2 hosts or plugins).
