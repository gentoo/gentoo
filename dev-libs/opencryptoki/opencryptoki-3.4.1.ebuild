	# Since upstream by default seem to enable any possible token, even
	# when they don't seem to be used, we limit ourselves to the
	# software emulation token (swtok) and if the user enabled the tpm
	# USE flag, tpmtok.  The rest of the tokens seem to be hardware- or
	# software-dependent even when they build fine without their
	# requirements, but until somebody asks for those, I'd rather not
	# enable them.

	# We don't use --enable-debug because that tinkers with the CFLAGS
	# and we don't want that. Instead we append -DDEBUG which enables
	# debug information.
