This is a module for the AWS SDK for C. It handles all IO and TLS work for application protocols.

aws-c-io is an event driven framework for implementing application protocols. It is built on top of cross-platform
abstractions that allow you as a developer to think only about the state machine and API for your protocols. A typical
use-case would be to write something like Http on top of asynchronous-io with TLS already baked in. All of the platform
and security concerns are already handled for you.

It is designed to be light-weight, fast, portable, and flexible for multiple domain use-cases such as: embedded,
server, client, and mobile.
