POCO, the C++ Portable Components, is a collection of open source
C++ class libraries that simplify and accelerate the development of
network-centric, portable applications in C++. The libraries integrate
perfectly with the C++ Standard Library and fill many of the functional
gaps left open by it. Their modular and efficient design and implementation
makes the C++ Portable Components extremely well suited for embedded
development, an area where the C++ programming language is becoming
increasingly popular, due to its suitability for both low-level (device
I/O, interrupt handlers, etc.) and high-level object-oriented development.
Of course, POCO is also ready for enterprise-level challenges.

The POCO libraries free developers from re-inventing the wheel, and allow
them to spend their time on more worthwhile areas, such as getting things
done quickly and working on the features that make their application unique.
