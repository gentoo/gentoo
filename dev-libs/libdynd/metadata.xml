  LibDyND, a component of the Blaze project, is a C++ library for
  dynamic, multidimensional arrays. It is inspired by NumPy, the
  Python array programming library at the core of the scientific
  Python stack, but tries to address a number of obstacles encountered
  by some of its users. Examples of this are support for
  variable-sized string and ragged array types. The library is in a
  preview development state, and can be thought of as a sandbox where
  features are being tried and tweaked to gain experience with them.
