    LibDyND, a component of the Blaze project, is a C++ library for
    dynamic, multidimensional arrays. It is inspired by NumPy, the
    Python array programming library at the core of the scientific
    Python stack, but tries to address a number of obstacles encountered
    by some of its users. Examples of this are support for
    variable-sized string and ragged array types. The library is in a
    preview development state, and can be thought of as a sandbox where
    features are being tried and tweaked to gain experience with them.
