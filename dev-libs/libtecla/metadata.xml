  The tecla library provides UNIX and LINUX programs with interactive
  command line editing facilities, similar to those of the UNIX tcsh
  shell. In addition to simple command-line editing, it supports
  recall of previously entered command lines, TAB completion of file
  names or other tokens, and in-line wild-card expansion of
  filenames. The internal functions which perform file-name completion
  and wild-card expansion are also available externally for optional
  use by programs.
