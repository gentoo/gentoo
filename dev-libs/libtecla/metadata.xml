		The tecla library provides UNIX and LINUX programs with interactive
		command line editing facilities, similar to those of the UNIX tcsh
		shell. In addition to simple command-line editing, it supports
		recall of previously entered command lines, TAB completion of file
		names or other tokens, and in-line wild-card expansion of
		filenames. The internal functions which perform file-name completion
		and wild-card expansion are also available externally for optional
		use by programs.
