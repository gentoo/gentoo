EET is a tiny library designed to write an arbitary set of chunks of data to a file 
and optionally compress each chunk (very much like a zip file) and allow fast 
random-access reading of the file later on. It does not do zip as a zip itself has 
more complexity than is needed, and it was much simpler to impliment this once here.

Eet is extremely fast, small and simple. Eet files can be very small and highly 
compressed, making them very optimal for just sending across the internet without 
having to archive, compress or decompress and install them. They allow for 
lightning-fast random-acess reads once created, making them perfect for storing data 
that is written once (or rarely) and read many times, but the program does not want 
to have to read it all in at once.

It also can encode and decode data structures in memory, as well as image data for 
saving to Eet files or sending across the network to other machines, or just writing 
to arbitary files on the system. All data is encoded in a platform independant way 
and can be written and read by any architecture.
