  The <pkg>libmaa</pkg> library provides many low-level data structures which
  are helpful for writing compilers, including hash tables, sets, lists,
  debugging support, and memory management. Although <pkg>libmaa</pkg> was
  designed and implemented as a foundation for the KHEPERA Transformation
  System, the data structures are generally applicable to a wide range of
  programming problems. The memory management routines are especially helpful
  for improving the performance of memory-intensive applications.
