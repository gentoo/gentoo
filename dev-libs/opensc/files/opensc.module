# This file describes how to load the opensc module
# See: http://p11-glue.freedesktop.org/doc/p11-kit/config.html

# This is a relative path, which means it will be loaded from
# the p11-kit default path which is usually $(libdir)/pkcs11.
# Doing it this way allows for packagers to package opensc for
# 32-bit and 64-bit and make them parallel installable
module: onepin-opensc-pkcs11.so
