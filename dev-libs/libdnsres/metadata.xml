	Libdnsres provides a non-blocking thread-safe API for resolving DNS names.
	It requires that your main application is built on top of libevent.
	Libdnsres' API essentially mirrors the traditional gethostbyname and
	getaddrinfo interfaces. All return values have been replaced by callbacks
	instead. The code borrows heavily from the BSD resolver library. In fact, it
	is an extremely ugly hack to make the BSD resolver library non-blocking and
	thread-safe without changing the API too much.
