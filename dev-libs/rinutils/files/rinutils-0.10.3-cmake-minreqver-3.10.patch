Subject: [PATCH] Raise CMake minimum version to 3.10..3.31 range

CMake 3.10 was released in 2017. Fixes warning since CMake-3.31:

CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of
CMake.

Update the VERSION argument value. Or, use the ... syntax
to tell CMake that the project requires at least but has been updated
to work with policies introduced by or earlier.
