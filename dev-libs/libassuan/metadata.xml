In an ideal world, Assuan is irrelevant.  Assuan's primary use is to
allow a client to interact with a non-persistent server.  Using Assuan,
this is accomplished by forking a subprocess and communicating with it
via, for example, a pipe or unix domain socket.  This method is neither
elegant nor efficient especially when there is a lot of data spread
across several transactions: not only is there a penalty for an
increased number of context switches, but also a significant amount of
data is MEMCPYed from the client to a file descriptor and from the file
descriptor to the server.
