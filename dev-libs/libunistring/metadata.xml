	Text files are nowadays usually encoded in Unicode, and may consist of very
	different scripts – from Latin letters to Chinese Hanzi –, with many kinds
	of special characters – accents, right-to-left writing marks, hyphens, Roman
	numbers, and much more. But the POSIX platform APIs for text do not contain
	adequate functions for dealing with particular properties of many Unicode
	characters. In fact, the POSIX APIs for text have several assumptions at
	their base which don't hold for Unicode text.
	This library provides functions for manipulating Unicode strings and for
	manipulating C strings according to the Unicode standard.
