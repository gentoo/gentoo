    Text files are nowadays usually encoded in Unicode, and may consist of very
    different scripts – from Latin letters to Chinese Hanzi –, with many kinds
    of special characters – accents, right-to-left writing marks, hyphens, Roman
    numbers, and much more. But the POSIX platform APIs for text do not contain
    adequate functions for dealing with particular properties of many Unicode
    characters. In fact, the POSIX APIs for text have several assumptions at
    their base which don't hold for Unicode text.
    This library provides functions for manipulating Unicode strings and for
    manipulating C strings according to the Unicode standard.
