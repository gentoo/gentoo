		A fork of Intel's Hyperscan, modified to run on more platforms.
		Currently ARM NEON/ASIMD is 100% functional, and Power VSX are in
		development. ARM SVE2 support is in ongoing with access to hardware now.
		More platforms will follow in the future.

		Vectorscan follows Intel's API and internal algorithms where
		possible, but will not hesitate to make code changes where it is thought
		of giving better performance or better portability.
