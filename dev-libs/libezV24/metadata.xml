	The goal of this library is to provide an easy to use programming interface to
	the serial ports of the Linux system. This release comes with some support for
	the CYGWIN toolchain. Due to the great work of the cygwin folks, only minimal
	changes are needed. I know that the cygwin-stuff of 'ezV24' isn't the final
	stuff, but it's a first step and it works.
