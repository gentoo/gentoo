    Editline is a line editing library for UNIX. It can be linked into
    almost any program to provide command line editing and history. It is
    call compatible with the FSF readline library, but is a fraction of the
    size (and offers fewer features). The small size, lack of dependencies
    and the free license should make this library interesting to many
    embedded developers seeking a replacement for the GNU readline library.
