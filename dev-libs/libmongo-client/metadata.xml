        This is an alternative C driver for MongoDB, with slightly different
        goals than the official one:
        libmongo-client is meant to be a stable (API, ABI and quality alike), 
        clean, well documented and well tested shared library, that strives 
        to make the most common use cases as convenient as possible.
