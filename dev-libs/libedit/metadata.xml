GNU Readline is cool, but BSD Readline is cooler :)
Thus here is libedit by the NetBSD folks!
The glibc/bsdlibc stuff comes from the debian tarball, thanks to them too :)
The patch is handcrafted with a few ideas from libedit.sf.net and a few ideas
from the debian package.  This patch aims to be as small as possible (so as
to make future cvs snapshots cake).
