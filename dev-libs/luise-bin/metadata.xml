		The libluise.so lib provides a very simple interface for programming
		the USB LCDs ready. The programmer has three independent screens available,
		a text screen and two graphic screens. The screens are each 320x240 pixels.
		By the two separate graphic screens can be very easily superimposed static and
		represent dynamic data. This is for example when using background images
		helpful because the environment of the dynamic data / graphics is not constantly recalculated
		got to. All three screens will appear "on top of each other" on the LCD and will go through
		previously defined parameters (LUI_LCDmode ()) corresponding to each other bitwise
		connected. The coordinate origin (x = 0, y = 0) of a screen is always in the
		left upper corner. In addition, the inversion and the rotation of the screens
		supports (90 Â° steps), while saving the programmer the coordinates conversions stay.
