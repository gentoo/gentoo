Subject: [PATCH] fix race when symlink shareds libs

When the crypto/ssl targets attempt to build their shared libs, they run:
	cd ..; make libcrypto.so.1.0.0
The top level Makefile in turn runs the build-shared target for that lib.

The build-shared target depends on both do_$(SHLIB_TARGET) & link-shared.
When building in parallel, make is allowed to run both of these.  They
both run Makefile.shared for their respective targets:
do_$(SHLIB_TARGET) ->
	link_a.linux-shared ->
	link_a.gnu ->
	...; $(LINK_SO_A) ->
	$(LINK_SO) ->
	$(SYMLINK_SO)
link-shared ->
	symlink.linux-shared ->
	symlink.gnu ->
	...; $(SYMLINK_SO)

The shell code for SYMLINK_SO attempts to do a [ -e lib ] check, but fails
basic TOCTOU semantics.  Depending on the load, that means two processes
will run the sequence:
	rm -f libcrypto.so
	ln -s libcrypto.so.1.0.0 libcrypto.so

Which obviously fails:
	ln: failed to create symbolic link 'libcrypto.so': File exists

Since we know do_$(SHLIB_TARGET) will create the symlink for us, don't
bother depending on link-shared at all in the top level Makefile when
building things.
