The goal of the SafeStr library is to provide a rich string-handling library
for C that has safe semantics yet interoperates with legacy library code in a
straightforward manner.  Additionally, porting code that uses standard C string
handling should be straightforward.  The library should work on all modern
Unix-like platforms, as well as any 32-bit Microsoft Windows OS.
