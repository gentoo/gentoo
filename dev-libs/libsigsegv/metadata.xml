This is a library for handling page faults in user mode. A page fault occurs
when a program tries to access to a region of memory that is currently not
available. Catching and handling a page fault is a useful technique for
implementing:

  - pageable virtual memory,
  - memory-mapped access to persistent databases,
  - generational garbage collectors,
  - stack overflow handlers,
  - distributed shared memory,
