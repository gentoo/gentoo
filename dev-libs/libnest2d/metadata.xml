		Libnest2D is a library and framework for the 2D bin packaging problem. Inspired from the SVGNest Javascript
		library the project is built from scratch in C++11. The library is written with a policy that it should be
		usable out of the box with a very simple interface but has to be customizable to the very core as well. The
		algorithms are defined in a header only fashion with templated geometry types. These geometries can have custom
		or already existing implementation to avoid copying or having unnecessary dependencies.

		A default backend is provided if the user of the library just wants to use it out of the box without additional
		integration. This backend is reasonably fast and robust, being built on top of boost geometry and the
		polyclipping library. Usage of this default backend implies the dependency on these packages but its header only
		as well.
