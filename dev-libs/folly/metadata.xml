		Folly (acronymed loosely after Facebook Open Source Library) is a library of C++11 components designed with practicality and efficiency in mind.
		Folly contains a variety of core library components used extensively at Facebook. In particular, it's often a dependency of Facebook's other open
		source C++ efforts and place where those projects can share code.

		It complements (as opposed to competing against) offerings such as Boost and of course std. In fact, we embark on defining our own component only
		when something we need is either not available, or does not meet the needed performance profile. We endeavor to remove things from folly if or
		when std or Boost obsoletes them.

		Performance concerns permeate much of Folly, sometimes leading to designs that are more idiosyncratic than they would otherwise be
		(see e.g. PackedSyncPtr.h, SmallLocks.h). Good performance at large scale is a unifying theme in all of Folly.
