		Miniz is a lossless, high performance data compression library in a single source file that implements the zlib
		(RFC 1950) and Deflate (RFC 1951) compressed data format specification standards. It supports the most commonly
		used functions exported by the zlib library, but is a completely independent implementation so zlib's licensing
		requirements do not apply. Miniz also contains simple to use functions for writing .PNG format image files and
		reading/writing/appending .ZIP format archives. Miniz's compression speed has been tuned to be comparable to
		zlib's, and it also has a specialized real-time compressor function designed to compare well against
		fastlz/minilzo.
