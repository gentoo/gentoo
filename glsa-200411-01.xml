  <title>ppp: No denial of service vulnerability</title>
  <synopsis>
    pppd contains a bug that allows an attacker to crash his own connection,
    but it cannot be used to deny service to other users.

    <p>
    ppp is a Unix implementation of the Point-to-Point Protocol.

  <description>
    <p>
    The pppd server improperly verifies header fields, potentially leading to a
    crash of the pppd process handling the connection. However, since a
    separate pppd process handles each ppp connection, this would not affect
    any other connection, or prevent new connections from being established.

  <impact type="low">
    <p>
    We incorrectly thought that this bug could be exploited to deny service to
    all ppp users. It is not the case, this bug has no security impact
    whatsoever. Many thanks to Paul Mackerras from the Samba team for
    correcting our mistake.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no need for a workaround.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    ppp users can keep their current versions.
    </p>
