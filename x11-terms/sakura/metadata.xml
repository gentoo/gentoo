    sakura is a terminal emulator based on GTK and VTE. It's a terminal emulator
    with few dependencies, so you don't need a full GNOME desktop installed to
    have a decent terminal emulator. Current terminal emulators based on VTE are
    gnome-terminal, XFCE Terminal, TermIt and a small sample program included
    in the vte sources. Sakura differences from the last one is that it uses a
    notebook to provide several terminals in one window and adds a contextual
    menu with some basic options. No more no less.
