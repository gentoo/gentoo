		Alacritty is a terminal emulator with a strong focus on simplicity and performance.
		With such a strong focus on performance, included features are carefully considered and you can always expect Alacritty to be blazingly fast.
		By making sane choices for defaults, Alacritty requires no additional setup.
		However, it does allow configuration of many aspects of the terminal.
