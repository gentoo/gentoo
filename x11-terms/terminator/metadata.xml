	Much of the behaviour of Terminator is based on GNOME Terminal, and 
	we are adding more features from that as time goes by, but we also 
	want to extend out in different directions with useful features for 
	sysadmins and other users. If you have any suggestions, please file 
	wishlist bugs! (see below for the address)
