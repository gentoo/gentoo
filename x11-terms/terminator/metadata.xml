		Much of the behaviour of Terminator is based on GNOME Terminal, and
		we are adding more features from that as time goes by, but we also
		want to extend out in different directions with useful features for
		sysadmins and other users. If you have any suggestions, please file
		wishlist bugs! (see below for the address)
