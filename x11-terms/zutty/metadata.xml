    Zutty is a terminal emulator for the X Window System, functionally
    similar to several other X terminal emulators such as xterm, rxvt
    and countless others. It is also similar to other, much more
    modern, GPU-accelerated terminal emulators such as Alacritty and
    Kitty. What really sets Zutty apart is its radically simple, yet
    extremely efficient rendering implementation, coupled with a
    sufficiently complete feature set to make it useful for a wide
    range of users. Zutty offers high throughput with low latency, and
    strives to conform to relevant (published or de-facto) standards.
