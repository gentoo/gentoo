AirTraf 1.0 is a wireless sniffer that can detect and determine exactly what is
being transmitted over 802.11 wireless networks. This open-source program
tracks and identifies legitimate and rogue access points, keeps performance
statistics on a by-user and by-protocol basis, measures the signal strength of
network components, and more. Do you want to capture the sky?
