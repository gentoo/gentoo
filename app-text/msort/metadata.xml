		Msort is a program for sorting files in sophisticated ways.
		It was originally developed for alphabetizing dictionaries of "exotic" languages
		in formats like those used by Shoebox and Toolbox, for which it has been extensively used,
		but is useful for many other purposes.
		Msort differs from typical sort utilities in providing greater flexibility in parsing
		the input into records and identifying key fields and greater control over the sort order.
