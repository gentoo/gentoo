    This software implements various state-of-the-art algorithms for
    algorithmic learning of XML Schema definitions and Document Type
    Definitions.

    Given a set or a single XML instance it can algorithmically infer
    a schema which describes the XML instances. The resulting schemas
    are of high-quality and human readable.

    The theory behind the project is described in Kore Nordmann's
    thesis, "Algorithmic learning of XML Schema definitions from XML
    data," available at
    http://kore-nordmann.de/talks/11_03_learning_xml_schema_definitions_from_xml_data.pdf.
