# The build system checks for "poppler-glib", which is provided only
# when app-text/poppler is built with USE=cairo. Moreover the glib ABI
# of poppler is relatively stable, and I can only assume that diff-pdf
# uses that rather than the low-level libpoppler.so API. Since the
# subslot on app-text/poppler is ONLY for the low-level API, we
# therefore don't need a subslot dependency on app-text/poppler.
#
# Since diff-pdf.cpp includes glib.h directly, I've included
# dev-libs/glib as an explicit dependency. Ditto for x11-libs/cairo.
