# Dictionaries are listed below. During dictd startup the OpenRC init script will
# scan ${DLIBDIR} (see /etc/conf.d/dictd) and adds all of the dictionaries it
# finds here. 
# 
# On the other hand, if you are running systemd, you will need to look at
# /usr/share/doc/dictd-${PV}/dictd.conf.example as reference to know the format
# of the lines you will need to manually add below.
#
# NOTE: OpenRC init script will wipe everything below #LASTLINE and replace it with
# what it finds. So add all of your things above. If this is a problem, report
# bug at https://bugs.gentoo.org, please.
#
# Do not remove next line!
