    DocOnce is a modestly tagged (Markdown-like) markup language targeting scientific reports,
    software documentation, books, blog posts, and slides involving much math and code in the text.
    From DocOnce source you can generate LaTeX, Sphinx, HTML, IPython notebooks, Markdown,
    MediaWiki, and other formats.
    This means that you from a single source can get the most up-to-date publishing technologies
    for paper, tablets, and phones.
