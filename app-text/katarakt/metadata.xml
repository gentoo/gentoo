    katarakt is a simple PDF viewer. It is designed to use as much available
    screen space as possible.

    There are currently two layouts. The presentation layout is very simple and
    only supports scrolling on a per page basis. As the name suggests the
    current page is displayed in the center and zoomed to fit the window. It is
    active by default.

    The grid layout is much more advanced and offers continuous (smooth, per
    pixel) scrolling, zooming and adjusting the column count. Pages keep their
    correct relative size and are shown in a grid.
