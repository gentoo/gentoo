.SH NAME
blahtexml \- Converts TeX equations into MathML
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blahtexml
.RI [ options ] " files" ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B blahtexml
command.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBblahtexml\fP converts an equation given in a syntax close to TeX into
MathML. Blahtexml is a simple extension of blahtex. In addition to
the functionality of blahtex, blahtexml has XML processing in mind
and is able to process a whole XML document into another XML
document. Instead of converting only one formula at a time, blahtexml
can convert all the formulas of the given XML file into MathML.
.SH OPTIONS
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
A summary of options is included below.
For a complete description, see the online documentation.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-\-texvc-compatible-commands
Enables use of commands that are specific to texvc, but that are not
standard TeX/LaTeX/AMS-LaTeX commands.
.TP
.B \-\-print-error-messages
This will print out a list of all error IDs and corresponding messages
that blahtex can possibly emit inside an <error> block.
.SH MATHML OPTIONS
These options control the MathML output of the blahtexml program.

.TP
.B \-\-mathml
Enables MathML output.
.TP
.B \-\-xmlin
This allows one to embed TeX equations in an existing MathML code, using
a special notation. The equations are given as attributes (inline or block)
in the http://gva.noekeon.org/blahtexml namespace. Whenever blahtexml meets
such an equation, it expands it into the equivalent MathML code.

.RE
.TP
.B \-\-annotate-TeX
Produces TeX annotations in the MathML output.
.TP
.B \-\-annotate-PNG
Produces PNG files and annotates the MathML output with the PNG file name.
