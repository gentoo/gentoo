<longdescription lang="en">
	 xindy is an index processor that can be used to generate book-like indexes
	 for arbitrary document-preparation systems. This includes systems such as
	 TeX and LaTeX, the roff-family, SGML/XML-based systems (e.g., HTML) that
	 process some kind of text and generate indexing information. The kernel
	 system is not fixed to any specific system, but can be configured to work
	 together with such systems.

	 In comparison to other index processors xindy has several powerful features
	 that make it an ideal framework for describing and generating complex
	 indices, addressing especially international indexing. Have a look at
	 xindy's Overview that describes its most important features!
