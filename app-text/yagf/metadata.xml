		YAGF is a graphical front-end for cuneiform and tesseract OCR tools.
		With YAGF you can open already scanned image files or obtain new images
		via XSane (scanning results are automatically passed to YAGF).
		Once you have a scanned image you can prepare it for recognition, select
		particular image areas for recognition, set the recognition language and
		so no. Recognized text is displayed in a editor window where it can be
		corrected, saved to disk or copied to clipboard.
		YAGF also provides some facilities for a multi-page recognition (see
		the online help for more details).
