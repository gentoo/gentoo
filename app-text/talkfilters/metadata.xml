  The GNU Talk Filters are filter programs that convert ordinary English text
  into text that mimics a stereotyped or otherwise humorous dialect. These
  filters have been in the public domain for many years, but now for the first
  time they are provided as a single integrated package. The filters include
  austro, b1ff, brooklyn, chef, cockney, drawl, dubya, fudd, funetak, jethro,
  jive, kraut, pansy, pirate, postmodern, redneck, valspeak, and warez. Each
  program reads from standard input and writes to standard output. The package
  also provides the filters as a C library, so they can be easily used by other
  programs.
