		GNU diction and style are free implementations of old standard unix
		commands, that are not available on many modern systems, because they
		have been unbundled. Diction prints wordy and commonly misused phrases.
		Style analyses surface characteristics of a document, e.g. sentence
		length and various readability measures, but unlike the original code,
		it lacks sentence type, word usage and most sentence beginning
		processing.

		Both commands support English and German documents.
