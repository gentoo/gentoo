You are almost done!

  1. Restart your webserver

  2. Open the file '${MY_INSTALLDIR}/initialize/db.inc.php'
     in a text editor and edit the values of the variables '\$databaseName', 
	 '\$username' and '\$password' to fit your needs.
	 (Note that you'll be able to use the refbase package without modifying
	 these variables, but we highly recommend not to use the default
	 values!)

  3. Now, open a web browser and access the 'install.php' script by typing:

     <http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/install.php>

     This should bring up the install form.  Edit the contents of all text 
	 entry fields to match your server setup and supply the MySQL admin
     password, then click the 'Install' button to install the database.

  4. For further instructions, see /usr/share/doc/refbase-0.8.0/INSTALL.gz
				 
  Enjoy!
