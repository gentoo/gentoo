		KchmViewer is a chm (MS HTML help file format) viewer It uses Trolltech Qt
		widget library with optional KDE libraries. It does not require KDE, but may
		be compiled with full KDE support, including KDE widgets and KIO/KHTML. The
		main advantage of KchmViewer is extra support for non-English languages.
		Unlike other viewers, KchmViewer in most cases is able to detect help file
		encoding, correctly shows tables of context of Russian, Korean, Chinese and
		Japanese help files, and does correct search in non-English help files
		(search for MBCS languages - ja/ko/ch is still in progress).
