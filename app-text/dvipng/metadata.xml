  This program makes PNG and/or GIF graphics from DVI files as obtained
  from TeX and its relatives.

  If GIF support is enabled, GIF output is chosen by using the ‘dvigif’
  binary or with the ‘--gif’ option.

  It is intended to produce anti-aliased screen-resolution images as fast
  as is possible. The target audience is people who need to generate and
  regenerate many images again and again. The primary target is the
  preview-latex (X)Emacs package, a package to preview formulas from within
  (X)Emacs. Yes, you get to see your formulas in the (X)Emacs buffer, see
  &lt;https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/preview-latex.html&gt;.
