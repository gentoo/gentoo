		The DVIPDFMx (formerly dvipdfm-cjk) project provides an eXtended
		version of the dvipdfm, a DVI to PDF translator developed by Mark A.
		Wicks. The primary goal of this project is to support multi-byte
		character encodings and large character sets for East Asian languages
		by CID-keyed font technology.  The secondary goal is to support as
		many features as pdfTeX developed by Han The Thanh. This project is a
		combined work of the dvipdfm-jpn project by Shunsaku Hirata and its
		modified one, dvipdfm-kor, by Jin-Hwan Cho.
