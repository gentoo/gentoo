		What is this thing? Why it's a rhyming dictionary, of course! But more
		specifically, it's a command-line program that takes a word and returns
		to you a formatted list of all words that rhyme with it. The default
		response is a perfect rhyme (which is probably what you want). Or you
		can get a syllable count of a certain word ("whitening" has 2-3
		syllables, etc.).
