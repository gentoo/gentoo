Paperwork is a personal document manager for scanned documents (and PDFs).

It's designed to be easy and fast to use. The idea behind Paperwork is "scan and forget": You should be able to just scan a new document and forget about it until the day you need it again.

In other words, let the machine do most of the work for you.
