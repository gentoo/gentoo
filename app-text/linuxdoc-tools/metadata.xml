	Linuxdoc-Tools is a small bug-fix version of SGML-Tools 1.0.9, and
	is a toolset for processing LinuxDoc DTD SGML files.  This system
	is tailored for LinuxDoc DTD sgml files, and other DTDs are not
	supported.  If you need the tool for DocBook DTD (which is now a
	more popular DTD than LinuxDoc in writing technical software
	documentation), then you should check other packages such as
	SGMLTools-Lite and OpenJade.
