		Linuxdoc-Tools is a small bug-fix version of SGML-Tools 1.0.9,
		and is a toolset for processing LinuxDoc DTD SGML files.
		This system is tailored for LinuxDoc DTD sgml files, and other DTDs
		are not supported. If you need the tool for DocBook DTD (which is
		now a more popular DTD than LinuxDoc in writing technical software
		documentation), then you should check SGMLTools-Lite, OpenJade,
		and docbook-tools.
