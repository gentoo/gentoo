.IP "\fB\-o\fR \fIoutput\fR" 4
If you do not define an output file with the \fB\-o\fR switch, Cuneiform writes the result to a file \[oq]cuneiform-out.\fIformat\fR\[cq]. The file extension depends on your output format.

.SH INPUT FORMAT
Cuneiform can process any single-page image that GraphicsMagick knows how to open. Please consult the \fBgm\fR(1) manual page for the comprehensive list of supported image formats.
