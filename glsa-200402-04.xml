    <p>
    Starting in the 1.3.1 release, Gallery includes code to simulate the behaviour
    of the PHP 'register_globals' variable in environments where that setting
    is disabled.  It is simulated by extracting the values of the various
    $HTTP_ global variables into the global namespace.

  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A crafted URL such as 
    http://example.com/gallery/init.php?HTTP_POST_VARS=xxx  causes the
    'register_globals' simulation code to overwrite the $HTTP_POST_VARS which,
    when it is extracted, will deliver the given payload. If the
    payload compromises $GALLERY_BASEDIR then the malicious user can perform a
    PHP injection exploit and gain remote access to the webserver with PHP 
    user UID access rights.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    The workaround for the vulnerability is to replace init.php and
    setup/init.php with the files in the following ZIP file:
    http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gallery/patch_1.4.1-to-1.4.1-pl1.zip?download 
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All users are encouraged to upgrade their gallery installation:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    # emerge -p "&gt;=www-apps/gallery-1.4.1_p1"
    # emerge "&gt;=www-apps/gallery-1.4.1_p1"</code>
