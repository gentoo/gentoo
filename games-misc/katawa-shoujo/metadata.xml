		Katawa Shoujo is a bishoujo-style visual novel set in the fictional
		Yamaku High School for disabled children, located somewhere in modern
		Japan. Hisao Nakai, a normal boy living a normal life, has his life
		turned upside down when a congenital heart defect forces him to move to
		a new school after a long hospitalization. Despite his difficulties,
		Hisao is able to find friendsâ€”and perhaps love, if he plays his cards
		right. There are five main paths corresponding to the 5 main female
		characters, each path following the storyline pertaining to that
		character.
