  <title>Apache 1.3: Multiple vulnerabilities</title>
  <synopsis>
    Several security vulnerabilities have been fixed in the latest release of
    Apache 1.3.

    The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
    open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems. The goal of this
    project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that
    provides services in tune with the current HTTP standards.

    <p>
    On 64-bit big-endian platforms, mod_access does not properly parse
    Allow/Deny rules using IP addresses without a netmask which could result in
    failure to match certain IP addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
    Terminal escape sequences are not filtered from error logs. This could be
    used by an attacker to insert escape sequences into a terminal emulater
    vulnerable to escape sequences.
    </p>
    <p>
    mod_digest does not properly verify the nonce of a client response by using
    a AuthNonce secret. This could permit an attacker to replay the response of
    another website. This does not affect mod_auth_digest.
    </p>
    <p>
    On certain platforms there is a starvation issue where listening sockets
    fails to handle short-lived connection on a rarely-accessed listening
    socket. This causes the child to hold the accept mutex and block out new
    connections until another connection arrives on the same rarely-accessed
    listening socket thus leading to a denial of service.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    These vulnerabilities could lead to attackers bypassing intended access
    restrictions, denial of service, and possibly execution of arbitrary code.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All users should upgrade to the latest stable version of Apache 1.3.
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=www-servers/apache-1.3.31"
    # emerge ">=www-servers/apache-1.3.31"</code>
