	This package provides a command line tool for documenting hardware
	and software designs through timing diagrams.  It reads signal descriptions
	from a text file with an intuitive syntax, and outputs a timing diagram to
	an image file.  Notation typical of timing diagrams found in the Electrical
	Engineering discipline is used, including arrows indicating causal
	relationships between signal transitions.
