		xnec2c is a GTK+ graphical interactive version of nec2c. It incorporates
		the nec2c core which it uses for reading input files and calculating
		output data, but it does not need and indeed does not produce an output
		file by default. Since xnec2c incorporates the nec2c core, it has access
		to all internal buffers, including structure data, frequency-related
		data (structure currents, input impedance, gain etc) and radiation
		pattern data (for the far field and near field). It therefore has the
		ability to graphically display user-requested data directly, as the
		frequency loop progresses or after input from the user. Graphs of
		frequency-related data and the current or charge distribution evolve as
		the frequency loop progresses, and radiation patterns (far and near
		field) are sequentially drawn for each frequency step. A new frequency
		can be entered by the user from spin buttons in the main or radiation
		pattern windows or by clicking on the graphs of frequency-related data.
		New output data are then computed and displayed in text and graphical
		form.
