  Balsa is an asynchronous circuit synthesis system developed over a number of
  years at the APT group of the School Of Computer Science, The University of
  Manchester. Balsa is built around the Handshake Circuits methology and can
  generate gate level netlists from high-level descriptions in the Balsa
  language. Both dual-rail (QDI) and single-rail (bundled data) circuits can be
  generated.
