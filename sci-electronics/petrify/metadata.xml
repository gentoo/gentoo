  Petrify is a tool for synthesis of Petri nets and asynchronous controllers.
  Petrify is able to obtain Petri nets with some specific properties: pure, free
  choice, unique choice, place irredundant, etc... The Petri nets accepted by
  petrify can also be interpreted as Signal Transition Graphs describing the
  behavior of asynchronous controllers. Petrify is able to solve the Complete
  State Coding problem and generate a speed-independent circuit.
