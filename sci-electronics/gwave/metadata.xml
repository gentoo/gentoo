  Gwave is a waveform viewer. Gwave can read binary or ascii files written by
  HSpice from transient, AC, or Sweep analyses, "raw" files written by Spice2,
  Spice3, or ngspice, and transient analysis files from the CAzM simulator. It
  can also read a generic tabular ASCII format suitable for use with GnuCap or
  homegrown tools.
