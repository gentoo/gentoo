  <longdescription>
    GHDL is a shorthand for G Hardware Design Language (currently, G has no
    meaning). It is a VHDL analyzer, compiler, simulator and (experimental)
    synthesizer that can process (nearly) any VHDL design. Unlike some other
    simulators, GHDL is a compiler: it directly translates a VHDL file to
    machine code, without using an intermediary language such as C or C++.
    Therefore, the compiled code should be faster and the analysis time should
    be shorter than with a compiler using an intermediary language. GHDL can
    use multiple back-ends, i.e. code generators, (GCC, LLVM or x86/i386 only,
    a built-in one named mcode) and runs on GNU/Linux, Windows and macOS; on
    x86, x86_64, armv6/armv7/aarch32/aarch64, ppc64, etc. GHDL aims at
    implementing VHDL as defined by IEEE 1076. It supports the 1987, 1993 and
    2002 revisions and, partially, 2008 and 2019. Property Specification
    Language (PSL) is also partially supported.
