  SystemC provides hardware-oriented constructs within the context of C++
  as a class library implemented in standard C++. Its use spans design and
  verification from concept to implementation in hardware and software.
  SystemC provides an interoperable modeling platform which enables the
  development and exchange of very fast system-level C++ models. It also
  provides a stable platform for development of system-level tools.
