		 IRSIM is a tool for simulating digital circuits. It is a "switch-level"
		 simulator; that is, it treats transistors as ideal switches. Extracted
		 capacitance and lumped resistance values are used to make the switch a
		 little bit more realistic than the ideal, using the RC time constants
		 to predict the relative timing of events.
