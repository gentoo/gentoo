  Free, open source, GPL'ed VHDL simulator. The project goal is to develop a
  VHDL simulator that :
   * Has a graphical waveform viewer.
   * Has a source level debugger.
   * Is VHDL-93 compliant.
   * Is of commercial quality. (on par with, say, V-System - it'll take us a
     while to get there, but that should be our aim)
   * Is freely distributable - both source and binaries - like Linux itself.
     (Under the Gnu General Public License (GPL)).
   * Works with Linux. If others want to port it to other platforms they may,
     but it is not the goal of this project.
