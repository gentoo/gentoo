In Unreal, players take on the role of a criminal whose transfer ship 
has crashed on the mysterious planet Gryphon, where a peaceful race 
known as the Nali have been hunted and enslaved by bloodthirsty aliens 
called Skaarj. To dominate Gryphon and mine its precious Tarydium, the 
Skaarj command legions of other menacing species like the gigantic 
Titans, the bio-engineered Brutes and the pack-hunting Krall. Unreal 
combatants must survive in the midst of this inter-species warfare 
armed with an array of deadly weapons. Players will visit ancient Nali 
ruins, underground mines, cities in the sky, spacecraft wreckage and 
even the mysterious Skaarj Mothership in this deadly hunt in which 
every character is both predator and prey.
