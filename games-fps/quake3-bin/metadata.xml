Quake III Arena is the third installment of the extremely popular and 
successful Quake series by id software.  The game was released by id 
software for both Windows and Linux.  The Linux version of the game was 
maintained and sold by the now defunct Loki Entertainment.  The powerful 
Quake III engine is the basis for many other commercial games, as id's 
major source of revenue is licensing their game engines.  The engine 
allows for user-contributed modifications to be made, allowing the game 
to be extensible and expandable.  This game is commercial software, and 
requires the data from a retail copy of the game to play.  If you're 
interested in checking out the technology behind Quake III, then 
"emerge quake3-demo" to get the playable demo.
