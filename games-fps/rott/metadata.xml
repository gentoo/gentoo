  THE STORY

  You are part of an elite group of operatives called HUNT (High-risk
  United Nations Taskforce), and you must stop a maniac cult leader from
  killing millions of people. While scouting a remote island, you are
  suddenly surrounded by enemy troops with guns blaring. In the distance
  you see your boat--your only chance to escape--explode into matchsticks.
  In front of you is a huge fortress monastery, and your only chance to
  stop the madness. You are e quipped with awesome, high-tech weaponry
  like heat-seeking missiles, split missiles, and the Flamewall cannon,
  which leaves a trail of charred skeletons in its wake. You'll also find
  magical instruments and weapons so incredible they defy description.
