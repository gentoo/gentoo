THE STORY

You are part of an elite group of operatives called HUNT (High-risk 
United Nations Taskforce), and you must stop a maniac cult leader from 
killing millions of people. While scouting a remote island, you are 
suddenly surrounded by enemy troops with guns blaring. In the distance 
you see your boat--your only chance to escape--explode into matchsticks. 
In front of you is a huge fortress monastery, and your only chance to 
stop the madness. You are e quipped with awesome, high-tech weaponry 
like heat-seeking missiles, split missiles, and the Flamewall cannon, 
which leaves a trail of charred skeletons in its wake. You'll also find 
magical instruments and weapons so incredible they defy description.
