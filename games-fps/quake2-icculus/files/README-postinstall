This was taken from the README file in the source distribution
and cleaned up a bit. Read all of this, or at least skim it. Please?

Note:
1. If you install a new compile of quake2, you'll lose your savegames. I'm 
sorry. Don't upgrade in the middle of a single-player game.

===============================================================================

To emerge the Quake2 data:
--------------------------
1. emerge quake2-data

That was easy huh ? :)  Note: this requires the Quake2 CD and/or the data files
from an installed copy of the game (like for windows).

===============================================================================

To install the Quake2 demo data:
--------------------------------
1. download ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/q2-314-demo-x86.exe
2. unzip -L q2-314-demo-x86.exe into a temp directory
3. cp baseq2/pak0.pak to /usr/share/games/quake2-data/baseq2/pak0.pak

===============================================================================

To install the Quake2 gamedata from game CD:
--------------------------------------------
(assuming the cdrom is mounted at /cdrom)

1. cp /cdrom/Install/Data/baseq2/pak0.pak  /usr/share/games/quake2-data/baseq2/

2. cp /cdrom/Install/Data/baseq2/video/    /usr/share/games/quake2-data/baseq2/
   (optional)
   
3. Download ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/q2-3.20-x86-full.exe
   and extract the contents to a temporary directory (use unzip -L, as this 
   is a standard zip file).

4. cp <temp directory>/baseq2/pak1.pak /usr/share/games/quake2-data/baseq2/
5. cp <temp directory>/baseq2/pak2.pak /usr/share/games/quake2-data/baseq2/
6. cp <temp directory>/baseq2/players/ /usr/share/games/quake2-data/baseq2/

7. if you really want to use the crakhor model, you can find the
   skins/sounds on websites like http://www.mike-d.com/games/modskins.html
   (optional)

===============================================================================

Capture The Flag:
-----------
To run Capture The Flag, you need to do the following:

1. Download ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/q2-3.20-x86-full-ctf.exe
2. unzip that file (using unzip -L) into a temp directory
3. cp <temp directory>/ctf /usr/share/games/quake2-data/

Execute quake2 with:

quake2 +set game ctf +set dedicated 1
 -- or --
q2ded +set game ctf
===============================================================================

Joystick Support:
-----------------
Joystick should function on all compatible SDL platforms using the sdlquake2
binary as well as on linux using the linux kernel joystick API.

Joystick obeys the same free-look/strafe rules as mouse.  You can set these in
the options menu.

There are four command line settings for joystick:
1. j_invert_y [1],0 if set to zero pulling back on the joystick points down
2. j_lr_axis [0] set the axis which controls left right movement
3. j_ud_axis [1] set the axis which controls up down (in free-look) or 
   forward back (freelock off)
4. j_throttle [3] set the axis which controls the players forward backward 
   throttle (if free-look is true)
