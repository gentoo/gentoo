Legends is a fast-paced first-person-perspective online multiplayer 
game. The game is designed to take advantage of the beautiful 
environments available from the Torque engine it is based on while still 
offering the breakneck pacing and variety of styles available from such 
classics as Quake and Tribes.

Gameplay is not the strafe-strafe-jump-strafe-shoot-strafe-run-like-hell 
style a lot of games espouse; the addition of a jetpack adds a third 
dimension of mobility that makes skill, forethought, and restraint 
necessities to winning.

Team sizes are going to be ideal between 10 and 15 on each side, and the 
network code will allow anyone with any bandwidth to play relatively 
smoothly. Game type offerings will range from the classic Capture the 
Flag to our own new type, affectionately called "Knockout".

Plenty of maps will be provided by us, but the beauty of this game is 
its customization possibilities. Mission creation has never been easier, 
with a stable, full-featured editor integrated into the game engine 
itself. Skins, models, and effects can all be modified by the end-user 
with commonly available tools.
