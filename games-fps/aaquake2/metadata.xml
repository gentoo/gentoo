aaquake2 - Text Mode Quake II

What?
Just what you heard - text mode Quake II.

Why?
Why not? You can watch TV in text mode, you can play DVDs in text mode, 
you can play Quake 1 in text mode. Quake II is the logical next step.

Or, as the author of ttyquake put it, "If you have to ask why, you're 
not a member of the intended audience."
