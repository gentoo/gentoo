Excessive Plus is a Quake III Arena modification. It is a remake of the
ingenious Mr. Pants' Excessive Overkill for Quake III Arena
(www.planetquake.com/excessive/).

Well, what's then the difference?
Excessive Plus can either be used server-side only but also as a client-server
mod which brings you tons of advantages. The whole mod is based on a scripting
engine which can be used to create your very own settings. It is fully
customizable with tons of options. Read the "docs/index.html" for more
information.
