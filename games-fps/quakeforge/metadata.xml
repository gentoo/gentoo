QuakeForge is a 3D graphics game engine based on id Software's legendary 
Quake and QuakeWorld game engine. Our purpose? To improve the state of 
the game by improving the engine and making it accessable to the largest 
number of players we can.

Arguably the single most important issue on the minds of players today 
is the rampant cheating which is currently happening on many of the 
larger servers. It's a serious problem and it really makes a good game 
hard to find. We're working hard to fix these problems at the engine 
level.

But what good is that if you have to have a copy of our client and the 
server has to run our server? There are other projects out there and 
some of them have very unique qualities. QuakeForge is cooperating with 
QSG, a group comprised of representatives from nearly every known Quake 
source project to ensure that our clients and servers run with other 
clients and servers just fine. We have all agreed to implement any 
effective cheat prevention methods.

Other things we're doing include merging the two code trees, adding 
features, and improving the OpenGL renderer. And QuakeForge is still the 
most portable source tree based on the id Software code.
