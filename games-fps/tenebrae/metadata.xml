Tenebrae is a modification of the quake source that adds stencil shadows 
and per pixel lights to quake. Stencil shadows allow for realistic 
shadow effects on every object in the game world. Per pixel lighting 
allows you to have fine surface details correctly lit. These are 
essentially the same algorithms as used by the new Doom game.
