In the single player mode, the player squares off 
against computer controlled Bots in all the game modes 
through a tournament ladder with increasing difficulty. 
Thanks to Epic's unmatched AI coding wizardry, Unreal 
Tournament's Bots are more life like than any 
computer-controlled characters to date. They understand 
each game's unique rules. They have a firm handle on all 
the different weapons at their disposal and how best to 
use them. They can swim, use elevators, climb stairs, 
and put on Toxin suits if they have to. If they're on 
the player's team, they can take orders to attack, 
defend or freelance.

Unreal Tournament's bread and butter is the online multiplayer 
mode. Squaring off against other combatants from around the world, or on 
the other end of a LAN connection, provides some of the most thrilling and 
tense battles seen on a PC. Unreal Tournament's unparalleled networking 
code makes it as easy to play the game against anyone, anytime. If the 
host server has unique content -- like custom skins or maps -- UT 
will automatically download and install that content in REAL TIME, as the 
game is connecting. And thanks to Epic Games' amazing work on Unreal 
Tournament's network play, you can be sure that even a 33.6K modem can get 
a silky smooth connection to the server.
