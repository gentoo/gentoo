		Proton Mail Bridge has been open-source since April 2020.
		It functions as a daemon that serves as an interface between Proton
		Mail's encrypted email services and standard IMAP/SMTP email clients.
		This allows users to integrate Proton Mail with applications like
		Thunderbird, Outlook, and Apple Mail.
		The Bridge can be compiled with or without its Qt-based graphical
		user interface (GUI), offering flexibility for both desktop and
		headless environments.
