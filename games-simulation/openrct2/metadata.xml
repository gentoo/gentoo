		OpenRCT2 is an open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 (RCT2),
		expanding the game with new features, fixing bugs and raising game limits.
		The gameplay revolves around building and maintaining an amusement park containing attractions,
		shops and facilities. The player must try to make a profit and maintain a good park reputation
		whilst keeping the guests happy. OpenRCT2 allows for both scenario and sandbox play.
		Scenarios require the player to complete a certain objective in a set time limit whilst
		sandbox allows the player to build a more flexible park with optionally no restrictions or finance.
