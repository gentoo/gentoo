Building a bridge that doesn't break is what its all about, although watching 
your bridge creation break and plunge a train into the watery depths below can be 
half the fun. In the Bridge Construction Set you design and build bridges and 
then stress test them to see how your creations hold up under pressure. If when 
test vehicles pass over your bridge they make it safely across you know you've
succeeded. If they plummet into the river you know you need to go back to the 
drawing board.

The robust physics deployed in the Bridge Construction Set let you build a wide 
variety of bridges that can span the river. The 3D graphics allow you to view 
your bridge from any angle including a first person train view - its like being 
strapped to the front of the train when your bridge is first tested (if this 
happened in real life I think we might have engineers checking all their bridges 
in a simulator).

The Bridge Construction Set includes many types of bridge building levels in 
varying degrees of difficulty from simple to complex with a tutorial secition to 
get you started. A Level Editor is also included so you can create your own 
levels and trade them with others.
