The primary focus of WFMath is geometric objects. Thus, it includes several
shapes (boxes, balls, lines), in addition to the basic math objects that are
used to build these shapes (points, vectors, matricies).
Most of the library classes can be divided into two sorts. The first kind are
basic mathematical objects, whose members are all fundamental types. The second
kind are shapes, which implement the shape class interface described in
doc/shape.h.
