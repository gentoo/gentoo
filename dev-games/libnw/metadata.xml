libnw - libnw's aim is to provide platform-independent routines for the low- and 
mid-level manipulation of NWN resources, as members of game data files, modules, hak 
paks, export files, or stand alone. As a side effect, command-line programs are 
often produced to exercise portions of the library. Ultimately, these routines are 
intended to be assembled along with some form of GUI to make an equivalent to 
BioWare's Aurora Toolset.
libnw is very much a work in progress, coded in C, and initially developed on ia32 
hardware running GNU/Linux. Members of the OK Project have assisted in porting the 
code to Mac OS X, as well.
