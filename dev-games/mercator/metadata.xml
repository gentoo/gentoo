	Mercator is primarily aimed at terrain for multiplayer online games and forms
	one of the WorldForge core libraries. It is intended to be used as a terrain
	library on the client, while a subset of features are useful on the server.

	Mercator is designed in such a way that individual tiles can be generated
	on-the-fly from a very small source data set. Each tile uses a fast
	deterministic random number generation to ensure that identical results are
	produced "anytime, anywhere". This enables transmission of terrain across low
	bandwidth links as part of the standard data stream, or server side collision
	detection with the same terrain that the player sees.

	The use of tiles means that there is inherently a large degree of gross control
	of the shape of the terrain. Finer control is implemented by allowing geometric
	modifications - for example, a polygonal area might be flattened, or a crater
	could be applied.
