HawkNL is a free, open source, game oriented network API released under 
the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL). HawkNL (NL) is a fairly 
low level API, a wrapper over Berkeley/Unix Sockets and Winsock. But NL 
also provides other features including support for many OSs, groups of 
sockets, socket statistics, high accuracy timer, CRC functions, macros 
to read and write data to packets with endian conversion, and support 
for multiple network transports. NL has been tested on Windows 
9x/ME/NT/2000/XP/CE, Linux, Solaris, IRIX, AIX, BSDs, MacOS 7-9 and 
MacOS X. There are also the two high level APIs, HawkNLU(tm) (NLU) 
and HawkVoice(tm), which are built on top of NL. It is NLU and 
HawkVoice(tm) that are most exciting, since they give developers 
portable, easy to use alternatives to Microsoft®'s DirectPlay® and 
DirectPlay® Voice.
