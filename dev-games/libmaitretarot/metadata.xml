MaitreTarot is a Tarot card game. Understand a game like freecell or poker, 
nothing to do with astrology. Tarot is rather a French game.

MaitreTarot is made of two kind of elements:

    * A server, that knows the rules, that gives the cards to the clients, that 
counts the points, and everything else that a server should do.
    * Clients. The main idea is to have differents clients. Some would be 
clients for human players, with a GUI (gtk+, qt, web, ncurses, win32...). And 
some would be AI. That would allow users to play with AI, and even AI 
tournaments could be played in order to know the best AI!
