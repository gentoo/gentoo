		ProSystem JG is an emulator for the Atari 7800. This
		is a fork of ProSystem 1.3e with patches from OpenEmu,
		which contains patches derived from Wii7800 and js7800.
		The code has been significantly altered. It was ported
		from C++ to C, and all of the dependencies and Windows-
		specific code were removed.
