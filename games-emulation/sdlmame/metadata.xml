SDLMAME is a port of the popular MAME[tm]. There are a few principles that guide it's development:

1) run on Linux/Unix, Mac OS X, and other SDL supported operating systems with as few changes as
possible to the base Win32 code. This means we can track changes faster than larger more conventional
ports such as MacMAME, and we also maintain what I call "Firefox compatibilty" where learning a major
app only needs to be done once per application, and it then applies across many operating systems. If
you can use the command-line Win32 MAME, you already know how to use SDLMAME on any platform you may
encounter it on.

2) MAME developers are important. By keeping quickly up to date, we make it easy for people on
non-Windows platforms to make and submit changes to the core MAME code, and we offer native
implementations of MAME's multi-window GUI debugger on both Linux/Unix and Mac OS X.
