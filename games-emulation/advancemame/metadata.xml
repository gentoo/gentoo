AdvanceMAME and AdvanceMESS are unofficial MAME and MESS versions with an advanced video support for 
helping the use with TVs, Arcade Monitors, Fixed Frequencies Monitors and also for PC Monitors.

They run in GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, DOS, Windows and in all the other platforms supported by the SDL library.

The main difference compared with the official emulators is that the Advance versions program directly the 
video board to always get a video mode with the correct size and frequency.

Generally the Advance emulators are able to use a video mode which doesn't require any stretching or other 
unneeded effects to match the original arcade display. When the stretching is required by hardware 
limitations you can anyway choice from different types of stretch.
