		The Jolly Good Reference Frontend is the simplest possible
		frontend for The Jolly Good API. It is intended to remain this
		way, and to avoid unnecessary feature creep, ensuring that it is
		easy to learn from. In order to deliver a smooth and enjoyable
		experience, a few slightly more advanced features are required. In
		these instances, effort has been taken to ensure readability
		and understandability of the code that implements these concepts.
