		The Digital Chart of the World (DCW) is a comprehensive 1:1,000,000
		scale vector basemap of the world. The charts were designed to meet
		the needs of pilots and air crews in medium-and low-altitude
		en route navigation and to support military operational planning,
		intelligence briefings, and other needs. DCW-GMT is an enhancement
		to DCW in a few ways: (1) it contains more state boundaries,
		and (2) the data have been reformatted to save space and are
		distributed as a single deflated netCDF-4 file.
