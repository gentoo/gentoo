  <longdescription lang="en">
    An application for finding a route between two points using the dataset
    of topographical information collected by http://www.OpenStreetMap.org.
    This router uses a routing algorithm that takes OSM format data as its input
    and calculates either the shortest or quickest route between two points.
    To optimise the routing a custom database format is used.
    This allows the routing to be performed quickly after a modest one-off pre-processing stage.
