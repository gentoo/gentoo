  GSHHS is a high-resolution shoreline data set amalgamated from two
  databases in the public domain. The data have undergone extensive
  processing and are free of internal inconsistencies such as erratic
  points and crossing segments. The shorelines are constructed
  entirely from hierarchically arranged closed polygons. The data can
  be used to simplify data searches and data selections, or to study
  the statistical characteristics of shorelines and land-masses.
