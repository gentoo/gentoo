	QSynth is a fluidsynth GUI front-end application written in C++ around the
	Qt toolkit using Qt Designer. Eventually it may evolve into a softsynth
	management application allowing the user to control and manage a variety of
	command line softsynth but for the moment it wraps the excellent FluidSynth.
	FluidSynth is a command line software synthesiser based on the Soundfont
	specification.
