		The main purpose of declick is the removal of digital clicks in the
		input material. It is intended for the automatic removal of clicks
		produced by scratched CDs or poorly working CD grabbers, for example
		when using an IDE CD-ROM. It is not designed to remove analogue clicks
		as from scratched LPs.
