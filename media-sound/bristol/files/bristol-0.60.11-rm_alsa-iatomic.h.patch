Description: Stop using alsa/iatomic.h
             Technically this is an API breakage in libasound 1.1.2,
             but it makes sense to me that this header was removed
             by ALSA upstream.
             .
             bristol was the only user in Debian, and even here the
             code that once used it was already commented out.
