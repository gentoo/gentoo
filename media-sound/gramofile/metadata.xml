GramoFile is intended primarily for transferring gramophone records to CDs, but
has many other possible uses. It can record very long .wav files with a bargraph
signal peak-level meter, playback any part of the files, split long .wav files
into separate tracks (with automatic track location), and process the signal
with filters to reduce ticks and pops (multiple filters are provided, they can
be applied in any order (multiple instances) with user-adjustable parameters).
Track splitting and signal processing are done in the same run, and don't need
any temporary files.
