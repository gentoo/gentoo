    ChucK is a programming language for real-time sound synthesis and music
    creation. It is open-source and freely available on MacOS X, Windows, and
    Linux. ChucK presents a unique time-based, concurrent programming model
    that is precise and expressive (we call this strongly-timed), dynamic
    control rates, and the ability to add and modify code on-the-fly. In
    addition, ChucK supports MIDI, OpenSoundControl, HID device, and
    multi-channel audio. It is fun and easy to learn, and offers composers,
    researchers, and performers a powerful programming tool for building and
    experimenting with complex audio synthesis/analysis programs, and real-time
    interactive music.
