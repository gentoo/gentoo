		Chordii is a fork of Chord, a program very popular several years
		ago and most famous for its trendsetting 'ChordPro' music file format.

		Chordii's purpose is to provide guitar players with a tool to produce
		good looking, self-descriptive music sheets from text files.

		Chordii reads a text file containing the lyrics of a song, the chords
		to be played, their description and some other optional data to
		produce a PostScript document that includes:

			* Centered titles
			* Chord names above the words
			* Graphical representation of the chords at the end of the songs
			* Transposition
			* Multiple columns on a page
			* Index of a songbook
			* Multiple logical pages per physical pages (1, 2 or 4)
			* Configurable fonts for the lyrics and the chord names
			* Multiple songs inside one file
			* The complete ISO 8859-1 character set
			* Chorus marking
