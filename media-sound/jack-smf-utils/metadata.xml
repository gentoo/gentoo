	Jack-smf-utils is a set of two utilities - jack-smf-player and
	jack-smf-recorder - whose purpose is to play and record MIDI streams from/to
	Standard Midi Files (i.e. the files with .mid extension) using JACK MIDI.
	There is also smfsh, "SMF shell" that is kind of interactive, command line
	SMF files manipulation tool which started its life as a debugging aid. And
	finally libsmf, C library for loading, writing and manipulating the contents
	of SMF files.
