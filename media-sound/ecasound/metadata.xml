	Ecasound is a software package designed for multitrack audio
	processing. It can be used for simple tasks like audio playback,
	recording and format conversions, as well as for multitrack
	effect processing, mixing, recording and signal recycling.
	Ecasound supports a wide range of audio inputs, outputs and
	effect algorithms. Effects and audio objects can be combined
	in various ways, and their parameters can be controlled by operator
	objects like oscillators and MIDI-CCs. A versatile console mode
	user-interface is included in the package.
