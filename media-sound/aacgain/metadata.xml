	<longdescription lang="en">AACGain is a modification to Glen Sawyer's excellent mp3gain program.
		It supports AAC (mp4/m4a/QuickTime) audio files in addtion to mp3 files.
		If you are not familiar with mp3gain, stop reading this, and go to
		http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net.	AACGain normalizes the volume of digital
		music files using the ReplayGain algorithm. It works by modifying the
		global_gain fields in the mp4 samples. Free-form metadata tags are added
		to the file to save undo information, making the normalization process
		reversable. AACGain uses the same command-line user interface as mp3gain.</longdescription>
