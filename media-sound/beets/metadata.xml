        The purpose of beets is to get your music collection right once and for
        all. It catalogs your collection, automatically improving its metadata as
        it goes using the MusicBrainz database. (It also downloads cover art for
        albums it imports.) Then it provides a bouquet of tools for manipulating
        and accessing your music.

        Because beets is designed as a library, it can do almost anything you can
        imagine for your music collection. Via plugins, beets becomes a panacea:
        * Embed and extract album art from files’ tags.
        * Listen to your library with a music player that speaks the MPD protocol
        and works with a staggering variety of interfaces.
        * Fetch lyrics for all your songs from databases on the Web.
        * Manage your MusicBrainz music collection.
        * Analyze music files’ metadata from the command line.
        * Clean up crufty tags left behind by other, less-awesome tools.
        * Browse your music library graphically through a Web browser and play it
        in any browser that supports HTML5 Audio.

        If beets doesn’t do what you want yet, writing your own plugin is
        shockingly simple if you know a little Python.
