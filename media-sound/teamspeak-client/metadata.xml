		TeamSpeak is a proprietary voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) application
		for audio communication between users on a chat channel, much like a telephone conference call.
		Users typically use headphones with a microphone.
		The client software connects to a TeamSpeak server of the user's choice,
		from which the user may join chat channels.
