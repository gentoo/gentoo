	jack-keyboard is a virtual MIDI keyboard - a program that allows you to send
	JACK MIDI events (play ;-) using your PC keyboard. It's somewhat similar to
	vkeybd, except it uses JACK MIDI instead of ALSA, and the keyboard mapping
	is much better - it uses the same layout as trackers (like Impulse Tracker)
	did, so you have two and half octaves under your fingers.
