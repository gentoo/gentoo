	Virtual MIDI Piano Keyboard is a MIDI event generator and receiver. It
	doesn't produce any sound by itself, but can be used to drive a MIDI
	synthesizer (either hardware or software, internal or external). You can use
	the computer's keyboard to play MIDI notes, and also the mouse. You can use
	the Virtual MIDI Piano Keyboard to display the played MIDI notes from
	another instrument or MIDI file player. To do so, connect the other MIDI
	port to the input port of VMPK.
