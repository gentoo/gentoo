minit - a small yet feature-complete init

What works so far
    * It can start services and take dependencies into account.
    * It can restart services
    * It can start services in sync mode (i.e. wait until they 
terminate, to get around race conditions for static initializations)
    * There is a companion utility "msvc" that can be used much in the 
same way as the svc from daemontools. Communication works over two 
fifos, /etc/minit/in and /etc/minit/out. Those have to exist before 
minit is started and they should be owned by root and have mode 600.
    * There is a companion utility "pidfilehack" that can be used to do 
stuff like run ssh, wait a while, read the PID off /var/run/sshd.pid and 
tell minit this PID so it will know when sshd exits and can restart it.
    * It can pipe stdout to a dedicated log process.
