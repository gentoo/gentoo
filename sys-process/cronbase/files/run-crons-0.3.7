# 12 Oct 2008; Thilo Bangert <bangert@gentoo.org> run-crons:
#     ignore emacs backup files (bug #237200)
#     include logging patch (bug #140869)
#
# 08 Mar 2005; Aaron Walker <ka0ttic@gentoo.org> run-crons:
#     Ignore the error messages from find caused by race conditions, since
#     we could care less about the error as long as the file has been removed.
#     See bug 8506.
#
# 06 May 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org> run-crons:
#     Make the locking actually work.  The old code was racy.
#     Thanks to Mathias Gumz in bug 45155 for some cleanups.
#
# 23 Jun 2002; Jon Nelson <jnelson@gentoo.org> run-crons:
#     fixed a race condition, where cron jobs and run-crons wanted to
#     delete touch files
#
# 20 Apr 2002; Thilo Bangert <bangert@gentoo.org> run-crons:
#     moved lastrun directory to /var/spool/cron/lastrun
#
# Author: Achim Gottinger <achim@gentoo.org>
#
# Mostly copied from SuSE
#
# this script looks into /etc/cron.[hourly|daily|weekly|monthly]
# for scripts to be executed. The info about last run is stored in
# /var/spool/cron/lastrun
