	<longdescription>
		This lightweight cron daemon aims to be simple and secure, with just enough
		features to stay useful.
		Unlike other fatter cron daemons, though, this cron doesn't even try to manage
		environment variables or act as a shell.
		All jobs are run with `/bin/sh` for conformity and portability.
