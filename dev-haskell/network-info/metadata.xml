		This library provides simple read-only access to the
		local computer's networking configuration. It is
		currently capable of getting a list of all the network
		interfaces and their respective IPv4, IPv6 and MAC
		addresses.
		
		network-info has been tested and is known to work on
		Ubuntu 10.10, FreeBSD 9.0, Mac OS X 10.6.4 and Windows
		XP/7. It probably works on other flavours of Linux,
		OS X, FreeBSD and Windows as well.
