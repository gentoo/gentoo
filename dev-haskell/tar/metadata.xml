		This library is for working with .tar@ archive files. It
		can read and write a range of common variations of archive
		format including V7, USTAR, POSIX and GNU formats. It provides
		support for packing and unpacking portable archives. This
		makes it suitable for distribution but not backup because
		details like file ownership and exact permissions are not
		preserved.
