		A monad transformer version of the ST monad
		Warning! This monad transformer should not be used with monads that
		can contain multiple answers, like the list monad. The reason is that
		the will be duplicated across the different answers and this cause
		Bad Things to happen (such as loss of referential transparency). Safe
		monads include the monads State, Reader, Writer, Maybe and
		combinations of their corresponding monad transformers.
