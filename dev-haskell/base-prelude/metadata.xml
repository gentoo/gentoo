	<longdescription>
		A library which aims to reexport all the non-conflicting and
		most general definitions from the \"base\" package.
		This includes APIs for applicatives, arrows, monoids, foldables, traversables,
		exceptions, generics, ST, MVars and STM.
		
		This package will never have any dependencies other than \"base\".
		
		/Versioning policy/
		
		The versioning policy of this package deviates from PVP in the sense
		that its exports in part are transitively determined by the version of \"base\".
		Therefore it's recommended for the users of \"base-prelude\" to specify
		the bounds of \"base\" as well.
