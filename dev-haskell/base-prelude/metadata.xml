	<longdescription>
		A library which aims to reexport all the non-conflicting and
		most general definitions from the \&quot;base\&quot; package.
		This includes APIs for applicatives, arrows, monoids, foldables, traversables,
		exceptions, generics, ST, MVars and STM.
		
		This package will never have any dependencies other than \&quot;base\&quot;.
		
		/Versioning policy/
		
		The versioning policy of this package deviates from PVP in the sense
		that its exports in part are transitively determined by the version of \&quot;base\&quot;.
		Therefore it&#39;s recommended for the users of \&quot;base-prelude\&quot; to specify
		the bounds of \&quot;base\&quot; as well.
