		Common diff algorithm works on list structures:
		
		@
		diff :: Eq a =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [Edit a]
		@
		
		This package works on trees.
		
		@
		treeDiff :: Eq a =&gt; Tree a -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Edit (EditTree a)
		@
		
		This package also provides a way to diff arbitrary ADTs,
		using @Generics@-derivable helpers.
		
		This package differs from &lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gdiff gdiff&gt;,
		in a two ways: @tree-diff@ doesn&#39;t have patch function,
		and the &quot;edit-script&quot; is a tree itself, which is useful for pretty-printing.
		
		@
		&gt;&gt;&gt; prettyEditExpr $ ediff (Foo 42 [True, False] &quot;old&quot;) (Foo 42 [False, False, True] &quot;new&quot;)
		Foo
		{fooBool = [-True, +False, False, +True],
		fooInt = 42,
		fooString = -&quot;old&quot; +&quot;new&quot;}
