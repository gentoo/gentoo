		Common diff algorithm works on list structures:
		
		@
		diff :: Eq a =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [Edit a]
		@
		
		This package works on trees.
		
		@
		treeDiff :: Eq a =&gt; Tree a -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Edit (EditTree a)
		@
		
		This package also provides a way to diff arbitrary ADTs,
		using @Generics@-derivable helpers.
		
		This package differs from &lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gdiff gdiff&gt;,
		in a two ways: @tree-diff@ doesn't have patch function,
		and the "edit-script" is a tree itself, which is useful for pretty-printing.
		
		@
		&gt;&gt;&gt; prettyEditExpr $ ediff (Foo 42 [True, False] "old") (Foo 42 [False, False, True] "new")
		Foo
		{fooBool = [-True, +False, False, +True],
		fooInt = 42,
		fooString = -"old" +"new"}
		@
