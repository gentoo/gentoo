		The @text@ package provides high performance functions for decoding strict and lazy @ByteString@s into @Text@. However, these functions present two issues for streaming data libraries: they throw exceptions from pure code, and are not designed for incremental consumption. This library addresses both issues with a unified API for UTF-8, -16LE, -16BE, -32LE, and -32BE. It is intended for use by high level streaming data libraries, such as conduit, enumerator, iteratee, and pipes.
