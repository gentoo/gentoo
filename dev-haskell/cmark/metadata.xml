		This package provides Haskell bindings for
		&lt;https://github.com/jgm/cmark libcmark&gt;, the reference
		parser for &lt;http://commonmark.org CommonMark&gt;, a fully
		specified variant of Markdown. It includes sources for
		libcmark (0.19.0) and does not require prior installation of the
		C library.
		
		cmark provides the following advantages over existing
		Markdown libraries for Haskell:
		
		-   Speed: Conversion speed is on par with the
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sundown sundown&gt;
		library. We were unable to measure precisely
		against
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sundown sundown&gt;,
		which raised a malloc error when compiled into our
		benchmark suite. Relative to other implementations:
		cmark was 82 times faster than
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cheapskate cheapskate&gt;,
		59 times faster than
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/markdown markdown&gt;,
		105 times faster than
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc pandoc&gt;,
		and 2.8 times faster than
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/discount discount&gt;.
		
		-   Memory footprint: Memory footprint is on par with
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sundown sundown&gt;.
		On one sample, the library uses a fourth the memory that
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/markdown markdown&gt;
		uses, and less than a tenth the memory that
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc pandoc&gt;
		uses.
		
		-   Robustness: cmark can handle whatever is thrown
		at it, without the exponential blowups in parsing
		time one can sometimes get with other libraries.
		(The input @bench\/full-sample.md@, for example,
		causes both
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc pandoc&gt;
		and
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/markdown markdown&gt;
		to grind to a halt.)
		
		-   Accuracy: cmark passes the CommonMark spec\'s
		suite of over 500 conformance tests.
		
		-   Standardization: Since there is a spec and a
		comprehensive suite of tests, we can have a high
		degree of confidence that any two CommonMark
		implementations will behave the same. Thus, for
		example, one could use this library for server-side
		rendering and
		&lt;https://github.com/jgm/commonmark.js commonmark.js&gt;
		for client-side previewing.
		
		-   Ease of installation: cmark is portable and has
		minimal dependencies.
		
		cmark does not provide Haskell versions of the whole
		&lt;https://github.com/jgm/cmark libcmark&gt; API, which is
		built around mutable @cmark_node@ objects. Instead, it
		provides functions for converting CommonMark to HTML
		(and other formats), and a function for converting
		CommonMark to a @Node@ tree that can be processed
		further using Haskell.
		
		A note on security: This library does not attempt
		to sanitize HTML output. We recommend using
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xss-sanitize xss-sanitize&gt;
		to filter the output.
		
		A note on stability: There is a good chance the API
		will change significantly after this early release.
