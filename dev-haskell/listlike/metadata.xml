	<longdescription>
		Generic support for list-like structures in Haskell.
		
		The ListLike module provides a common interface to the various Haskell
		types that are list-like.  Predefined interfaces include standard
		Haskell lists, Arrays, ByteStrings, and lazy ByteStrings.  Custom
		types can easily be made ListLike instances as well.
		
		ListLike also provides for String-like types, such as String and
		ByteString, for types that support input and output, and for types that can handle
		infinite lists.
