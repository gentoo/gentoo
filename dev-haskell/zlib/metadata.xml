		This package provides a pure interface for compressing and
		decompressing streams of data represented as lazy
		'ByteString's. It uses the zlib C library so it has high
		performance. It supports the \"zlib\", \"gzip\" and \"raw\"
		compression formats.
		
		It provides a convenient high level API suitable for most
		tasks and for the few cases where more control is needed it
		provides access to the full zlib feature set.
