		This library provides an abstraction of buffered output of
		byte streams and several convenience functions to exploit
		it. For example, it allows to efficiently serialize
		Haskell values to lazy bytestrings with a large average
		chunk size. The large average chunk size allows to make
		good use of cache prefetching in later processing steps
		(e.g. compression) and reduces the sytem call overhead
		when writing the resulting lazy bytestring to a file or
		sending it over the network.
