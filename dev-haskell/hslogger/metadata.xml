		hslogger is a logging framework for Haskell, roughly similar to
		Python's logging module.

		hslogger lets each log message have a priority and source be associated
		with it.  The programmer can then define global handlers that route
		or filter messages based on the priority and source.  hslogger also
		has a syslog handler built in.
