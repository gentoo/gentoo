		This package provides a canonical anonymous 1-tuple type missing
		from Haskell for attaching typeclass instances.
		
		NOTE: There is also the &lt;/package/OneTuple OneTuple package&gt; which
		by using a boxed @data@-type provides a 1-tuple type which has
		laziness properties which are more faithful to the ones of Haskell's
		native tuples; whereas the primary purpose of 'Only' is to
		provide the traditionally so named type-wrapper for attaching typeclass
		instances.
