		Hamlet gives you a type-safe tool for generating HTML code. It works via Quasi-Quoting, and generating extremely efficient output code. The syntax is white-space sensitive, and it helps you avoid cross-site scripting issues and 404 errors. Please see the documentation at &lt;http://docs.yesodweb.com/book/hamlet/&gt; for more details.
		
		Here is a quick overview of hamlet html. Due to haddock escaping issues, we can't properly show variable insertion, but we are still going to show some conditionals. Please see &lt;http://www.yesodweb.com/book/templates&gt; for a thorough description
