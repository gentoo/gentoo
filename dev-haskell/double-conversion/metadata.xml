		A library that performs fast, accurate conversion between double
		precision floating point and text.
		
		This library is implemented as bindings to the C++
		@double-conversion@ library written by Florian Loitsch at Google:
		&lt;http://code.google.com/p/double-conversion/&gt;.
		
		The 'Text' versions of these functions are about 30 times faster
		than the default 'show' implementation for the 'Double' type.
		
		The 'ByteString' versions are /slower/ than the 'Text' versions;
		roughly half the speed.  (This seems to be due to the cost of
		allocating 'ByteString' values via @malloc@.)
		
		As a final note, be aware that the @bytestring-show@ package is
		about 50% slower than simply using 'show'.
