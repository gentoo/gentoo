		This library provides bindings for the Dot language used by the
		Graphviz (&lt;http://graphviz.org/&gt;) suite of programs for visualising
		graphs, as well as functions to call those programs.
		
		Main features of the graphviz library include:
		
		* Almost complete coverage of all Graphviz attributes and syntax.
		
		* Support for specifying clusters.
		
		* The ability to use a custom node type.
		
		* Functions for running a Graphviz layout tool with all specified
		output types.
		
		* The ability to not only generate but also parse Dot code with two
		options: strict and liberal (in terms of ordering of statements).
		
		* Functions to convert FGL graphs and other graph-like data structures
		to Dot code - including support to group them into clusters - with a
		high degree of customisation by specifying which attributes to use
		and limited support for the inverse operation.
		
		* Round-trip support for passing an FGL graph through Graphviz to
		augment node and edge labels with positional information, etc.
