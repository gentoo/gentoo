		The hackage security library provides both server and
		client utilities for securing the Hackage package server
		(&lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/&gt;).  It is based on The Update
		Framework (&lt;http://theupdateframework.com/&gt;), a set of
		recommendations developed by security researchers at
		various universities in the US as well as developers on the
		Tor project (&lt;https://www.torproject.org/&gt;).
		
		The current implementation supports only index signing,
		thereby enabling untrusted mirrors. It does not yet provide
		facilities for author package signing.
		
		The library has two main entry points:
		"Hackage.Security.Client" is the main entry point for
		clients (the typical example being @cabal@), and
		"Hackage.Security.Server" is the main entry point for
		servers (the typical example being @hackage-server@).
		
		This is a beta release.
