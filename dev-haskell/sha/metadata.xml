		This library implements the SHA suite of message digest functions,
		according to NIST FIPS 180-2 (with the SHA-224 addendum), as well
		as the SHA-based HMAC routines. The functions have been tested
		against most of the NIST and RFC test vectors for the various
		functions. While some attention has been paid to performance,
		these do not presently reach the speed of well-tuned libraries,
		like OpenSSL.
