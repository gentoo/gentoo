		This package uses the same approach of type-safe URLs to create translated content. It has a simple syntax for translators, while allowing the ful power of Haskell for applying complex grammar rules.
		
		This package was spun off from yesod-core, and therefore the Yesod documentation is a good place to start in understanding this package. Please see &lt;http://www.yesodweb.com/book/i18n&gt; for more information.
