		Some carefully crafted libraries make promises to their
		users beyond functionality and performance.
		
		Examples are: Fusion libraries promise intermediate data
		structures to be eliminated. Generic programming libraries promise
		that the generic implementation is identical to the
		hand-written one. Some libraries may promise allocation-free
		or branch-free code.
		
		Conventionally, the modus operandi in all these cases is
		that the library author manually inspects the (intermediate or
		final) code produced by the compiler. This is not only
		tedious, but makes it very likely that some change, either
		in the library itself or the surrounding eco-system,
		breaks the library's promised without anyone noticing.
		
		This package provides a disciplined way of specifying such
		properties, and have them checked by the compiler. This way,
		this checking can be part of the ususal development cycle
		and regressions caught early.
		
		See the documentation in "Test.Inspection" or the project
		webpage for more examples and more information.
