		/Overview/
		
		The io-streams library contains simple and easy-to-use primitives for I/O
		using streams. Most users will want to import the top-level convenience
		module "System.IO.Streams", which re-exports most of the library:
		
		@
		import           "System.IO.Streams" (InputStream, OutputStream)
		import qualified "System.IO.Streams" as Streams
		@
		
		For first-time users, @io-streams@ comes with an included tutorial, which can
		be found in the "System.IO.Streams.Tutorial" module.
		
		/Features/
		
		The @io-streams@ user API has two basic types: @InputStream a@ and
		@OutputStream a@, and three fundamental I/O primitives:
		
		@
		\-\- read an item from an input stream
		Streams.'System.IO.Streams.read' :: 'System.IO.Streams.InputStream' a -&gt; IO (Maybe a)
		
		\-\- push an item back to an input stream
		Streams.'System.IO.Streams.unRead' :: a -&gt; 'System.IO.Streams.InputStream' a -&gt; IO ()
		
		\-\- write to an output stream
		Streams.'System.IO.Streams.write' :: Maybe a -&gt; 'System.IO.Streams.OutputStream' a -&gt; IO ()
		@
		
		Streams can be transformed by composition and hooked together with provided combinators:
		
		@
		ghci&gt; Streams.fromList [1,2,3::Int] &gt;&gt;= Streams.map (*10) &gt;&gt;= Streams.toList
		[10,20,30]
		@
		
		Stream composition leaves the original stream accessible:
		
		@
		ghci&gt; input \&lt;- Streams.fromByteString \"long string\"
		ghci&gt; wrapped \&lt;- Streams.takeBytes 4 input
		ghci&gt; Streams.read wrapped
		Just \"long\"
		ghci&gt; Streams.read wrapped
		Nothing
		ghci&gt; Streams.read input
		Just \" string\"
		@
		
		Simple types and operations in the IO monad mean straightforward and simple
		exception handling and resource cleanup using Haskell standard library
		facilities like 'Control.Exception.bracket'.
		
		@io-streams@ comes with:
		
		* functions to use files, handles, concurrent channels, sockets, lists,
		vectors, and more as streams.
		
		* a variety of combinators for wrapping and transforming streams, including
		compression and decompression using zlib, controlling precisely how many
		bytes are read from or written to a stream, buffering output using
		bytestring builders, folds, maps, filters, zips, etc.
		
		* support for parsing from streams using @attoparsec@.
		
		* support for spawning processes and communicating with them using streams.
		
		/ChangeLog/
		
		[@1.1.4.2@] Fixed a build error with network versions older than 2.4.
		
		[@1.1.4.1@] @System.IO.Streams.Network@: scalability improvement: buffers
		for socket reads are now allocated by system malloc rather than
		by pinned pointers in GHC (currently pinned pointer allocation
		takes a global lock).
		
		[@1.1.4.0@] Widened @attoparsec@ and @text@ library dependencies to allow
		the latest versions.
		
		[@1.1.3.0@] Added @System.IO.Streams.ByteString.takeExactly@. Widened
		@network@ dependency to include 2.3. Added a
		@NoInteractiveTests@ flag to selectively disable some tests for
		environments where spawning interactive processes is
		impossible.
		
		[@1.1.2.2@] Allowed newest versions of the @process@, @test-framework@,
		and @text@ libraries.
		
		[@1.1.2.1@] Fixed build error when compiled against attoparsec-0.10.0.x.
		
		[@1.1.2.0@] Added @System.IO.Streams.Concurrent.makeChanPipe@, to create a
		simple concurrent pipe between an @InputStream@/@OutputStream@
		pair.
		
		[@1.1.1.0@] Added @System.IO.Streams.Network.socketToStreamsWithBufferSize@,
		allowing control over the size of the receive buffers used when
		reading from sockets.
		
		[@1.1.0.3@] Fixed an inconsistent version upper bound in the test suite.
		
		[@1.1.0.2@] Fixed a typo in the tutorial.
		
		[@1.1.0.1@] A couple of Haddock markup fixes.
		
		[@1.1.0.0@] Reworked, simplified, and streamlined the internals of the
		library. Exports from "System.IO.Streams.Internal" relying on
		Sources and Sinks were deleted because they are no longer
		necessary: Source(..), Sink(..), defaultPushback,
		withDefaultPushback, nullSource, nullSink, singletonSource,
		simpleSource, sourceToStream, sinkToStream, generatorToSource,
		and consumerToSink.
		
		[@1.0.2.2@] Fixed a bug in which \"takeBytes 0\" was erroneously requesting
		input from the wrapped stream.
		
		[@1.0.2.1@] Fixed a compile error on GHC 7.0.x.
		
		[@1.0.2.0@] Added "System.IO.Streams.Process" (support for communicating
		with system processes using streams), added new functions to
		"System.IO.Streams.Handle" for converting @io-streams@ types to
		'System.IO.Handle's. (Now you can pass streams from this
		library to places that expect Handles and everything will
		work.)
		
		[@1.0.1.0@] Added 'System.IO.Streams.Combinators.ignoreEof'.
		
		[@1.0.0.1@] Fixed some haddock markup.
