		The @base@ library exposes the @hGetEcho@ and @hSetEcho@ functions
		for querying and setting echo status, but unfortunately, neither
		function works with MinTTY consoles on Windows. This is a serious
		issue, since @hGetEcho@ and @hSetEcho@ are often used to disable
		input echoing when a program prompts for a password, so many
		programs will reveal your password as you type it on MinTTY!
		
		This library provides an alternative interface which works
		with both MinTTY and other consoles. An example is included
		which demonstrates how one might prompt for a password using
		this library. To build it, make sure to configure with the
		@-fexample@ flag.
