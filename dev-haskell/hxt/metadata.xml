		The Haskell XML Toolbox bases on the ideas of HaXml and HXML,
		but introduces a more general approach for processing XML with Haskell.
		The Haskell XML Toolbox uses a generic data model for representing XML documents,
		including the DTD subset and the document subset, in Haskell.
		It contains a validating XML parser, a HTML parser, namespace support,
		an XPath expression evaluator, an XSLT library, a RelaxNG schema validator
		and funtions for serialization and deserialization of user defined data.
		The library makes extensive use of the arrow approach for processing XML.
		Since version 9 the toolbox is partitioned into various (sub-)packages.
		This package contains the core functionality,
		hxt-curl, hxt-tagsoup, hxt-relaxng, hxt-xpath, hxt-xslt, hxt-regex-xmlschema contain the extensions.
		hxt-unicode contains encoding and decoding functions,
		hxt-charproperties char properties for unicode and XML.
