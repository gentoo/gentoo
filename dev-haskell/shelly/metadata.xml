	<longdescription>
		Shelly provides convenient systems programming in Haskell,
		similar in spirit to POSIX shells. Shelly:
		
		* is aimed at convenience and getting things done rather than
		being a demonstration of elegance.
		
		* has detailed and useful error messages
		
		* maintains its own environment, making it thread-safe.
		
		* is modern, using Text and system-filepath/system-fileio
		
		Shelly is originally forked from the Shellish package.
		
		See the shelly-extra package for additional functionality.
		
		An overview is available in the README: &lt;https://github.com/yesodweb/Shelly.hs/blob/master/README.md&gt;
