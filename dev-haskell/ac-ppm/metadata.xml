		This package is written in 100% Haskell and enables you to
		write PPM (\"Portable Pixel Map\") images in human-readable
		text format as well as the more efficient binary format.
		It uses the ByteString library for maximum efficiency.
		For those that don't know, PPM is an image file format
		which is trivially simple, but therefore horribly inefficient.
		None the less, many programs can read PPM files, so this
		package represents an easy way to write Haskell code that
		generates images, without having to depend on any external
		C code.
