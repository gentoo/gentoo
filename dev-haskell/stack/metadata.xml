		Please see the documentation at &lt;https://docs.haskellstack.org&gt;
		for usage information.
		
		If building a 'stack' executable for distribution, please download the
		source code from &lt;https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases&gt;
		and build it using Stack itself in order to ensure identical behaviour
		to official binaries.  This package on Hackage is provided for convenience
		and bootstrapping purposes.
		
		Note that the API for the library is not currently stable, and may
		change significantly, even between minor releases. It is
		currently only intended for use by the executable.
