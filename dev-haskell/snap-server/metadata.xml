		Snap is a simple and fast web development framework and server written in
		Haskell. For more information or to download the latest version, you can
		visit the Snap project website at &lt;http://snapframework.com/&gt;.
		
		The Snap HTTP server is a high performance, epoll-enabled, iteratee-based web
		server library written in Haskell. Together with the @snap-core@ library upon
		which it depends, it provides a clean and efficient Haskell programming
		interface to the HTTP protocol.
		
		Higher-level facilities for building web applications (like user/session
		management, component interfaces, data modeling, etc.) are planned but not
		yet implemented, so this release will mostly be of interest for those who:
		
		* need a fast and minimal HTTP API at roughly the same level of abstraction
		as Java servlets, or
		
		* are interested in contributing to the Snap Framework project.
