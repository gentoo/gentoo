	<longdescription>
		A library of basic functionality needed for
		number-theoretic calculations. The aim of this library
		is to provide efficient implementations of the functions.
		Primes and related things (totients, factorisation),
		powers (integer roots and tests, modular exponentiation),
		integer logarithms.
		Note: Requires GHC &gt;= 6.12 with the integer-gmp package
		for efficiency. Portability is on the to-do list (with
		low priority, however).
