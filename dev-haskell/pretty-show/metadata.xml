		We provide a library and an executable for working with derived 'Show'
		instances. By using the library, we can parse derived 'Show' instances into a
		generic data structure. The @ppsh@ tool uses the library to produce
		human-readable versions of 'Show' instances, which can be quite handy for
		debugging Haskell programs.
