		This package exposes combinators that can wrap arbitrary
		monadic actions. They run the action and potentially retry
		running it with some configurable delay for a configurable
		number of times.
		The purpose is to make it easier to work with IO and
		especially network IO actions that often experience temporary
		failure and warrant retrying of the original action. For
		example, a database query may time out for a while, in which
		case we should hang back for a bit and retry the query instead
		of simply raising an exception.
