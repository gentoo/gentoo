		A /priority search queue/ efficiently supports the
		opperations of both a search tree and a priority queue. A
		'Binding' is a product of a key and a priority.  Bindings
		can be inserted, deleted, modified and queried in
		logarithmic time, and the binding with the least priority
		can be retrieved in constant time.  A queue can be built
		from a list of bindings, sorted by keys, in linear time.
