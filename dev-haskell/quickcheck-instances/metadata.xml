		QuickCheck instances.
		
		The goal is to supply QuickCheck instances for
		types provided by the Haskell Platform.
		
		Since all of these instances are provided as
		orphans, I recommend that you do not use this library
		within another library module, so that you don't
		impose these instances on down-stream consumers of
		your code.
		
		For information on writing a test-suite with Cabal
		see &lt;http://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/#test-suites&gt;
