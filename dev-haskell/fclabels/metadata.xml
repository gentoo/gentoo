		This package provides first class labels that can act as
		bidirectional record fields. The labels can be derived
		automatically using Template Haskell which means you don't have
		to write any boilerplate yourself. The labels are implemented as
		lenses and are fully composable. Labels can be used to /get/,
		/set/ and /modify/ parts of a datatype in a consistent way.
		
		See "Data.Label" for an introductory explanation.
		
		Internally lenses are not tied to Haskell functions directly,
		but are implemented as arrows. Arrows allow the lenses to be run
		in custom computational contexts. This approach allows us to
		make partial lenses that point to fields of multi-constructor
		datatypes in an elegant way.
		
		See the "Data.Label.Maybe" module for the use of partial labels.
