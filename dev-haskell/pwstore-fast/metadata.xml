		To store passwords securely, they should be salted,
		then hashed with a slow hash function. This library
		uses PBKDF1-SHA256, and handles all the details.
		It uses the cryptohash package for speed; if you need
		a pure Haskell library, pwstore-purehaskell has the
		exact same API, but uses only pure Haskell. It is
		about 25 times slower than this package, but still
		quite usable.
