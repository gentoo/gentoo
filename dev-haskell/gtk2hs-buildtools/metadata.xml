		This package provides a set of helper programs necessary to
		build the Gtk2Hs suite of libraries. These tools include
		a modified c2hs binding tool that is used to generate
		FFI declarations, a tool to build a type hierarchy that
		mirrors the C type hierarchy of GObjects found in glib,
		and a generator for signal declarations that are used
		to call back from C to Haskell. These tools are not needed
		to actually run Gtk2Hs programs.
