		An efficient implementation of Int-indexed arrays (both mutable
		and immutable), with a powerful loop optimisation framework .
		
		It is structured as follows:
		
		[&quot;Data.Vector&quot;] Boxed vectors of arbitrary types.
		
		[&quot;Data.Vector.Unboxed&quot;] Unboxed vectors with an adaptive
		representation based on data type families.
		
		[&quot;Data.Vector.Storable&quot;] Unboxed vectors of &#39;Storable&#39; types.
		
		[&quot;Data.Vector.Primitive&quot;] Unboxed vectors of primitive types as
		defined by the @primitive@ package. &quot;Data.Vector.Unboxed&quot; is more
		flexible at no performance cost.
		
		[&quot;Data.Vector.Generic&quot;] Generic interface to the vector types.
		
		Each module has a @Safe@ version with is marked as @Trustworthy@
		(see &lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/SafeHaskell&gt;).
		
		There is also a (draft) tutorial on common uses of vector.

		Changes in version 0.9
		
		* &#39;MonadPlus&#39; instance for boxed vectors
		
		* Export more @construct@ and @constructN@ from @Safe@ modules
		
		* Require @primitive-0.4.0.1@
		
		Changes in version 0.8
		
		* New functions: @constructN@, @constructrN@
		
		* Support for GHC 7.2 array copying primitives
		
		* New fixity for @(!)@
		
		* Safe Haskell support (contributed by David Terei)
		
		* &#39;Functor&#39;, &#39;Monad&#39;, &#39;Applicative&#39;, &#39;Alternative&#39;, &#39;Foldable&#39; and
		&#39;Traversable&#39; instances for boxed vectors
		(/WARNING: they tend to be slow and are only provided for completeness/)
		
		* &#39;Show&#39; instances for immutable vectors follow containers conventions
		
		* &#39;Read&#39; instances for all immutable vector types
		
		* Performance improvements
