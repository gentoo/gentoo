	HaRP, or Haskell Regular Patterns, is a Haskell extension that extends the
	normal pattern matching facility with the power of regular expressions. This
	expressive power is highly useful in a wide range of areas, including text
	parsing and XML processing. Regular expression patterns in HaRP work over
	ordinary Haskell lists ([]) of arbitrary type. HaRP is implemented as a
	pre-processor to ordinary Haskell.
