		Provides functions available in later versions of @base@ to
		a wider range of compilers, without requiring you to use CPP
		pragmas in your code.
		
		This package provides the same API as the
		@&lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-compat base-compat&gt;@
		library, but depends on compatibility packages
		(such as @semigroups@) to offer a wider support window than
		@base-compat@, which has no dependencies. Most of the modules
		in this library have the same names as in @base-compat@
		to make it easier to switch between the two. There also exist
		versions of each module with the suffix @.Repl.Batteries@,
		which are distinct from anything in @base-compat@, to allow
		for easier use in GHCi.
		
		See
		@&lt;https://github.com/haskell-compat/base-compat/blob/master/base-compat/README.markdown#dependencies here&gt;@
		for a more comprehensive list of differences between
		@base-compat@ and @base-compat-batteries@.
