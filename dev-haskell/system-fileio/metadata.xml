	<longdescription>
		This is a small wrapper around the \"directory\", \"unix\", and \"Win32\"
		packages, for use with \"system-filepath\". It provides a consistent API
		to the various versions of these packages distributed with different
		versions of GHC.
		
		In particular, this library supports working with POSIX files that have
		paths which can't be decoded in the current locale encoding.
