		This package provides an implementation of the ideas presented in the paper
		\"Functional Pearl: Implicit Configurations\" by Oleg Kiselyov and
		Chung-chieh Shan. However, the API has been streamlined to improve performance.
		
		The original paper can be obtained from
		&lt;http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/prepose/prepose.pdf&gt;.
		
		/Changes in 1.1.6/:
		
		* Relaxed an unnecessary strictness annotation in the fast implementation
		
		/Changes in 1.1.5/:
		
		* Both implementations now work on Hugs; the fast implementation ascends
		from the ranks of completely unportable black magic to being merely
		/mostly/ unportable black magic.
		
		/Changes from 0.5 to 1.1/:
		
		* Much faster implementation available that is about 50 /times/ faster than
		0.9 and which runs purely on black magic. This version is now used by
		default. To turn it off install with the @slow@ flag. If you encounter a
		problem with the implementation, please contact the author.
		
		* Removed @ReifiedNum@, @reflectNum@, and @reifyIntegral@; @reify@ and
		@reflect@ are about 3 orders of magnitude faster than the special case
		combinators were.
		
		/Changes in 0.5/:
		
		* Generalized the type signatures in reflect to allow you to pass any type
		with kind @* -&gt; *@ wrapped around the desired type as the phantom type
		argument rather than just a @Proxy@.
		
		/Changes in 0.4/:
		
		* Converted from `Data.Tagged` to using `Data.Proxy` for reflection. This
		reduces the need for helper functions and scoped type variables in user
		code.
