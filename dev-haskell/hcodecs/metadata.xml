		The library provides functions to read, write and manipulate MIDI, WAVE and
		SoundFont2 multimedia files. It is written entirely in Haskell (without any
		FFI). It uses efficient  parsing and building combinators for binary data
		stored in ByteStrings (based on the one in &#39;binary&#39; package).
		
		Correctness of significant parts of the library has been validated with
		QuickCheck and Haskell Program Coverage (HPC) tool-kits.
