		This library allows to load externally stored user interfaces into
		programs. This allows alteration of the interface without recompilation
		of the program.
		
		Note that this functionality is now provided in gtk directly
		(as of version 2.12 of the gtk+ C lib) by the
		Graphics.UI.Gtk.Builder module.
