		At its most general, Top is a framework for constructing abstract interpretations
		which focuses on giving good feedback on why an abstract interpretation does not give
		any useful information. In a mathematical notation this is usually made explicit by
		returning the top element of a (complete) lattice. This is also one of the reasons
		for the name of the project.
