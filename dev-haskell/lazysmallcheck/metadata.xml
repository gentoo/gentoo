		Lazy SmallCheck is a library for exhaustive, demand-driven testing of
		Haskell programs.  It is based on the idea that if a property holds
		for a partially-defined input then it must also hold for all
		fully-defined refinements of the that input.  Compared to ``eager&#39;&#39;
		input generation as in SmallCheck, Lazy SmallCheck may require
		significantly fewer test-cases to verify a property for all inputs up
		to a given depth.
