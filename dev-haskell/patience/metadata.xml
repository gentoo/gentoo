		This library implements the \&quot;patience diff\&quot; algorithm, as well as the patience
		algorithm for the longest increasing subsequence problem.
		
		Patience diff computes the difference between two lists, for example the
		lines of two versions of a source file.  It provides a good balance of
		performance, nice output for humans, and implementation simplicity.  For more
		information, see &lt;http://alfedenzo.livejournal.com/170301.html&gt; and
		&lt;http://bramcohen.livejournal.com/73318.html&gt;.
		
		New in version 0.1.1: relaxed @containers@ dependency, so it should build on
		GHC 6.10.
