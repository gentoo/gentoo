		This library implements the \"patience diff\" algorithm, as well as the patience
		algorithm for the longest increasing subsequence problem.
		
		Patience diff computes the difference between two lists, for example the
		lines of two versions of a source file.  It provides a good balance of
		performance, nice output for humans, and implementation simplicity.  For more
		information, see &lt;http://alfedenzo.livejournal.com/170301.html&gt; and
		&lt;http://bramcohen.livejournal.com/73318.html&gt;.
		
		New in version 0.1.1: relaxed @containers@ dependency, so it should build on
		GHC 6.10.
