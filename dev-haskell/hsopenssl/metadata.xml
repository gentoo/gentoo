		HsOpenSSL is an OpenSSL binding for Haskell. It can generate RSA
		and DSA keys, read and write PEM files, generate message digests,
		sign and verify messages, encrypt and decrypt messages. It has
		also some capabilities of creating SSL clients and servers.
		
		Please note that this project has started at the time when there
		were no pure-Haskell implementations of TLS. Now there is tls
		package (&lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tls&gt;), which looks
		pretty saner than HsOpenSSL especially for initialisation and
		error handlings. So PHO (the initial author of HsOpenSSL) highly
		encourages you to use and improve the tls package instead as long
		as possible.
