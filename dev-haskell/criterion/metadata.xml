	<longdescription>
		This library provides a powerful but simple way to measure the
		performance of Haskell code.  It provides both a framework for
		executing and analysing benchmarks and a set of driver functions
		that makes it easy to build and run benchmarks, and to analyse their
		results.
		
		The fastest way to get started is to read the documentation and
		examples in the Criterion.Main module.
