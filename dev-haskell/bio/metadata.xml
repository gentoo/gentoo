		This is a collection of data structures and algorithms
		useful for building bioinformatics-related tools
		and utilities.
		
		Current list of features includes: a Sequence data type supporting
		protein and nucleotide sequences and conversion between them.  As of version
		0.4, different kinds of sequence have different types.  Support for quality
		data, reading and writing Fasta formatted files, reading TwoBit and
		phd formats, and Roche/454 SFF files.  Rudimentary (i.e. unoptimized) support
		for doing alignments - including dynamic adjustment of scores based on sequence quality.
		Also Blast output parsing.  Partly implemented single linkage clustering, and
		multiple alignment.  Reading Gene Ontology (GO) annotations (GOA) and
		definitions\/hierarchy.
		
		The Darcs repository is at: &lt;http://malde.org/~ketil/biohaskell/biolib&gt;.
