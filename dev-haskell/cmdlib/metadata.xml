		A commandline parsing library, based on getopt. Comes with a
		powerful attribute system. Supports complex interfaces with many
		options and commands, with option &amp; command grouping, with simple
		and convenient API. Even though quite powerful, it strives to keep
		simple things simple. The library uses &quot;System.Console.GetOpt&quot; as
		its backend.
		
		In comparison to the other commandline handling libraries:
		
		Compared to cmdargs, cmdlib has a pure attribute system and is
		based on GetOpt for help formatting &amp; argument parsing. Cmdlib may
		also be more extendable due to typeclass design, and can use
		user-supplied types for option arguments.
		
		Cmdargs &gt;= 0.4 can optionally use a pure attribute system,
		although this is clearly an add-on and the API is a second-class
		citizen in relation to the impure version.
		
		GetOpt and parseargs both require explicit flag representation, so
		they live a level below cmdlib. GetOpt is in fact used as a
		backend by cmdlib.
