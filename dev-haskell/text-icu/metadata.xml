		Haskell bindings to the International Components for Unicode (ICU)
		libraries.  These libraries provide robust and full-featured Unicode
		services on a wide variety of platforms.
		
		Features include:
		
		* Both pure and impure bindings, to allow for fine control over efficiency
		and ease of use.
		
		* Breaking of strings on character, word, sentence, and line boundaries.
		
		* Access to the Unicode Character Database (UCD) of character metadata.
		
		* String collation functions, for locales where the conventions for
		lexicographic ordering differ from the simple numeric ordering of
		character codes.
		
		* Character set conversion functions, allowing conversion between
		Unicode and over 220 character encodings.
		
		* Unicode normalization.  (When implementations keep strings in a
		normalized form, they can be assured that equivalent strings have a
		unique binary representation.)
		
		* Regular expression search and replace.
