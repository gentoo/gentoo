		Haddock is a documentation-generation tool for Haskell
		libraries. These modules expose some functionality of it
		without pulling in the GHC dependency. Please note that the
		API is likely to change so specify upper bounds in your
		project if you can't release often. For interacting with Haddock
		itself, see the <pkg>dev-haskell/haddock</pkg> package.
