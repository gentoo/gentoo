		Pure Haskell implementation of SplitMix described in
		
		Guy L. Steele, Jr., Doug Lea, and Christine H. Flood. 2014.
		Fast splittable pseudorandom number generators. In Proceedings
		of the 2014 ACM International Conference on Object Oriented
		Programming Systems Languages &amp; Applications (OOPSLA &#39;14). ACM,
		New York, NY, USA, 453-472. DOI:
		&lt;https://doi.org/10.1145/2660193.2660195&gt;
		
		The paper describes a new algorithm /SplitMix/ for /splittable/
		pseudorandom number generator that is quite fast: 9 64 bit arithmetic/logical
		operations per 64 bits generated.
		
		/SplitMix/ is tested with two standard statistical test suites (DieHarder and
		TestU01, this implementation only using the former) and it appears to be
		adequate for &quot;everyday&quot; use, such as Monte Carlo algorithms and randomized
		data structures where speed is important.
		
		In particular, it __should not be used for cryptographic or security applications__,
		because generated sequences of pseudorandom values are too predictable
		(the mixing functions are easily inverted, and two successive outputs
		suffice to reconstruct the internal state).
