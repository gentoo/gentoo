		A custom prelude with no dependencies apart from base.
		
		This package has the following goals:
		
		* provide a base like sets of modules that provide a consistent set of features and bugfixes across multiple versions of GHC (unlike base).
		
		* provide a better and more efficient prelude than base's prelude.
		
		* be self-sufficient: no external dependencies apart from base.
		
		* provide better data-types: packed unicode string by default, arrays.
		
		* Better numerical classes that better represent mathematical thing (No more all-in-one Num).
		
		* Better I/O system with less Lazy IO
		
		* Usual partial functions distinguished through type system
