		This package provides several functions to quickly
		search for substrings in strict or lazy ByteStrings.
		It also provides functions for breaking or splitting
		on substrings and replacing all occurrences of a
		substring (the first in case of overlaps) with another.
		GHC before 6.10 are no longer supported, other compilers
		only if they support BangPatterns. If you need it to
		work with other compilers, send a feature request.
