		The Mersenne twister is a pseudorandom number generator developed by
		Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura that is based on a matrix linear
		recurrence over a finite binary field. It provides for fast generation
		of very high quality pseudorandom numbers. The source for the C code
		can be found here:
		
		&lt;http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt64.html&gt;
		
		This library provides a purely functional binding to the 64 bit
		classic mersenne twister, along with instances of RandomGen, so the
		generator can be used with System.Random. The generator should
		typically be a few times faster than the default StdGen (but a tad
		slower than the impure 'mersenne-random' library based on SIMD
		instructions and destructive state updates.
