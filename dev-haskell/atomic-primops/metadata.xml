	<longdescription>
		After GHC 7.4 a new `casMutVar#` primop became available, but it's
		difficult to use safely, because pointer equality is a highly
		unstable property in Haskell.  This library provides a safer method
		based on the concept of "Tickets".
		
		Also, this library uses the "foreign primop" capability of GHC to
		add access to other variants that may be of
		interest, specifically, compare and swap inside an array.
