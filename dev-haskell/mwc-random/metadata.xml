	<longdescription>
		This package contains code for generating high quality random
		numbers that follow either a uniform or normal distribution.  The
		generated numbers are suitable for use in statistical applications.
		
		The uniform PRNG uses Marsaglia's MWC256 (also known as MWC8222)
		multiply-with-carry generator, which has a period of 2^8222 and
		fares well in tests of randomness.  It is also extremely fast,
		between 2 and 3 times faster than the Mersenne Twister.
		
		Compared to the mersenne-random package, this package has a more
		convenient API, is faster, and supports more statistical
		distributions.
