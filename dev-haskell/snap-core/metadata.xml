		Snap is a simple and fast web development framework and server written in
		Haskell. For more information or to download the latest version, you can
		visit the Snap project website at &lt;http://snapframework.com/&gt;.
		
		This library contains the core definitions and types for the Snap framework,
		including:
		
		1. Primitive types and functions for HTTP (requests, responses, cookies,
		post/query parameters, etc)
		
		2. Type aliases and helper functions for Iteratee I/O
		
		3. A monad for programming web handlers called \"Snap\", inspired by
		happstack's (&lt;http://happstack.com/index.html&gt;), which allows:
		
		* Stateful access to the HTTP request and response objects
		
		* Monadic failure (i.e. MonadPlus/Alternative instances) for declining
		to handle requests and chaining handlers together
		
		* Early termination of the computation if you know early what you want
		to return and want to prevent further monadic processing
		
		/Quick start/: The 'Snap' monad and HTTP definitions are in "Snap.Core",
		some iteratee utilities are in "Snap.Iteratee".
		
		Higher-level facilities for building web applications (like user/session
		management, component interfaces, data modeling, etc.) are planned but not
		yet implemented, so this release will mostly be of interest for those who:
		
		* need a fast and minimal HTTP API at roughly the same level of abstraction
		as Java servlets, or
		
		* are interested in contributing to the Snap Framework project.
