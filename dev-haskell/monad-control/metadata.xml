		This package defines the type class @MonadControlIO@, a subset of
		@MonadIO@ into which generic control operations such as @catch@ can
		be lifted from @IO@.  Instances are based on monad transformers in
		@MonadTransControl@, which includes all standard monad transformers
		in the @transformers@ library except @ContT@.  For convenience, it
		provides a wrapped version of @Control.Exception@ with types
		generalized from @IO@ to all monads in @MonadControlIO@.

		Note that this package is a rewrite of Anders Kaseorg's @monad-peel@ library.
		The main difference is that this package provides CPS style
		operators and exploits the @RankNTypes@ language extension to
		simplify most definitions.

		The package includes a copy of the @monad-peel@ testsuite written by Anders Kaseorg.
		The tests can be performed by using @cabal test@.

		The following @critertion@ based benchmark shows that @monad-control@
		is on average about 2.5 times faster than @monad-peel@:
