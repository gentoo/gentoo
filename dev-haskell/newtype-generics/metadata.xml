		Per Conor McBride, the Newtype typeclass represents the packing and unpacking of a newtype,
		and allows you to operatate under that newtype with functions such as ala.
		Generics support was added in version 0.4, making this package a full replacement
		for the original newtype package, and a better alternative to newtype-th.
