	<longdescription>
		A practical incremental and one-pass, pure API to the
		&lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2 SHA-256 hash algorithm&gt;
		with performance close to the fastest implementations available in other languages.
		
		The implementation is made in C with a haskell FFI wrapper that hides the C implementation.
		
		NOTE: This package has been forked off @cryptohash-0.11.7@ because the @cryptohash@ has been
		deprecated and so this package continues to satisfy the need for a lightweight package
		providing the SHA256 hash algorithm without any dependencies on packages other than
		@base@ and @bytestring@.
		
		Consequently, this package can be used as a drop-in replacement for @cryptohash@'s
		"Crypto.Hash.SHA256" module, though with a clearly smaller footprint.
