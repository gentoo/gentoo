		This package provides the &#39;ShortText&#39; type which is suitable for keeping many short strings in memory. This is similiar to how &#39;ShortByteString&#39; relates to &#39;ByteString&#39;.
		
		The main difference between &#39;Text&#39; and &#39;ShortText&#39; is that &#39;ShortText&#39; uses UTF-8 instead of UTF-16 internally and also doesn&#39;t support zero-copy slicing (thereby saving 2 words). Consequently, the memory footprint of a (boxed) &#39;ShortText&#39; value is 4 words (2 words when unboxed) plus the length of the UTF-8 encoded payload.
