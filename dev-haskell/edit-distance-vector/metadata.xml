	<longdescription>
		An implementation of the Wagner-Fischer dynamic programming algorithm to
		find the optimal edit script and cost between two sequences.
		
		The implementation in this package is specialised to sequences represented
		with &quot;Data.Vector&quot; but is otherwise agnostic to:
		
		* The type of values in the vectors;
		
		* The type representing edit operations; and
		
		* The type representing the cost of operations.
