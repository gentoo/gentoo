	<longdescription>
		An implementation of the Wagner-Fischer dynamic programming algorithm to
		find the optimal edit script and cost between two sequences.
		
		The implementation in this package is specialised to sequences represented
		with "Data.Vector" but is otherwise agnostic to:
		
		* The type of values in the vectors;
		
		* The type representing edit operations; and
		
		* The type representing the cost of operations.
