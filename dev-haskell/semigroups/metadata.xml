		Haskell 98 semigroups
		
		In mathematics, a semigroup is an algebraic structure
		consisting of a set together with an associative binary
		operation. A semigroup generalizes a monoid in that there
		might not exist an identity element. It also (originally)
		generalized a group (a monoid with all inverses) to a type
		where every element did not have to have an inverse, thus the
		name semigroup.
