		This is the bytestring builder that is debuting in bytestring-0.10.4.0, which
		should be shipping with GHC 7.8, probably late in 2013.  This builder has
		several nice simplifications and improvements, and more out-of-box
		functionality than the older blaze-builder.
		
		Note that this package detects which version of bytestring you are compiling
		against,  and if you are compiling against bytestring-0.10.4 or later, will
		be an empty package.
		
		This package lets the new interface and implementation be used with most
		older compilers without upgrading bytestring, which can be rather
		problematic.  In conjunction with blaze-builder-0.4 or later,  which
		offers an implementation of blaze-builder in terms of bytestring-builder,
		this should let most people try the new interface and implementation without
		causing undue compatibility problems with packages that depend on
		blaze-builder.
		
		GHC 7.6 did debut an almost identical interface and implementation, but with
		slightly different module names and organization.   Trying to re-export/rename
		the builder provided with 7.6 did not turn out to be very practical,  because
		this interface includes new functions that rely on Builder internals,
		which are not exported in 7.6.  Furthermore, these module names should be
		deprecated in 7.10.
