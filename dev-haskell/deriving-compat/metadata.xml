		Provides Template Haskell functions that mimic deriving
		extensions that were introduced or modified in recent versions
		of GHC. Currently, the following extensions are covered:
		
		* @DeriveFoldable@
		
		* @DeriveFunctor@
		
		* @DeriveTraversable@
		
		The following changes have been backported:
		
		* In GHC 8.0, @DeriveFoldable@ was changed to allow folding
		over data types with existential constraints.
		
		* In GHC 8.0, @DeriveFoldable@ and @DeriveTraversable@ were
		changed so as not to generate superfluous @mempty@ or @pure@
		expressions in generated code. As a result, this allows
		deriving @Traversable@ instances for datatypes with unlifted
		argument types.
		
		* In GHC 8.0, deriving @Show@ was changed so that constructor fields
		with unlifted types are no longer shown with parentheses, and
		the output of showing an unlifted type is suffixed with the same
		number of hash signs as the corresponding primitive literals.
		
		* In GHC 8.2, deriving `Ord` was changed so that it generates concrete
		@if@-expressions that are not subject to @RebindableSyntax@.
		
		Note that some recent GHC extensions are not covered by this package:
		
		* @DeriveGeneric@, which was introducted in GHC 7.2 for deriving
		@Generic@ instances, and modified in GHC 7.6 to allow derivation
		of @Generic1@ instances. Use @Generics.Deriving.TH@ from
		@&lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-deriving generic-deriving&gt;@
		to derive @Generic(1)@ using Template Haskell.
		
		* @DeriveLift@, which was introduced in GHC 8.0 for deriving
		@Lift@ instances. Use @Language.Haskell.TH.Lift@ from
		@&lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/th-lift th-lift&gt;@
		to derive @Lift@ using Template Haskell.
