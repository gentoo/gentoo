		MinTTY is a Windows-specific terminal emulator for the
		widely used Cygwin and MSYS projects, which provide
		Unix-like environments for Windows. MinTTY consoles behave
		differently from native Windows consoles (such as
		@cmd.exe@ or PowerShell) in many ways, and in some cases,
		these differences make it necessary to treat MinTTY
		consoles differently in code.
		
		The @mintty@ library provides a simple way to detect if
		your code in running in a MinTTY console on Windows. It
		exports @isMinTTY@, which does the right thing 90% of the
		time (by checking if standard error is attached to
		MinTTY), and it also exports @isMinTTYHandle@ for the
		other 10% of the time (when you want to check is some
		arbitrary handle is attached to MinTTY). As you might
		expect, both of these functions will simply return @False@
		on any non-Windows operating system.
