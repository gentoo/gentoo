		OpenGLRaw is a raw Haskell binding for the OpenGL 3.2 graphics system and
		lots of OpenGL extensions. It is basically a 1:1 mapping of OpenGL's C API,
		intended as a basis for a nicer interface. OpenGLRaw offers access to all
		necessary functions, tokens and types plus a general facility for loading
		extension entries. The module hierarchy closely mirrors the naming structure
		of the OpenGL extensions, making it easy to find the right module to import.
		All API entries are loaded dynamically, so no special C header files are
		needed for building this package. If an API entry is not found at runtime, a
		userError is thrown.
		
		OpenGL is the industry's most widely used and supported 2D and 3D graphics
		application programming interface (API), incorporating a broad set of
		rendering, texture mapping, special effects, and other powerful visualization
		functions. For more information about OpenGL and its various extensions,
		please see &lt;http://www.opengl.org/&gt;
		and &lt;http://www.opengl.org/registry/&gt;.
