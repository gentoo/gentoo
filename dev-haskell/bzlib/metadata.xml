		This package provides a pure interface for compressing and
		decompressing streams of data represented as lazy
		&#39;ByteString&#39;s. It uses the bz2 C library so it has high
		performance.
		
		It provides a convenient high level API suitable for most
		tasks and for the few cases where more control is needed it
		provides access to the full bzip2 feature set.
