		This library provides QuickCheck properties to ensure
		that typeclass instances adhere to the set of laws that
		they are supposed to. There are other libraries that do
		similar things, such as `genvalidity-hspec` and `checkers`.
		This library differs from other solutions by not introducing
		any new typeclasses that the user needs to learn.
		
		/Note:/ on GHC &lt; 8.5, this library uses the higher-kinded typeclasses
		('Data.Functor.Classes.Show1', 'Data.Functor.Classes.Eq1', 'Data.Functor.Classes.Ord1', etc.),
		but on GHC &gt;= 8.5, it uses `-XQuantifiedConstraints` to express these
		constraints more cleanly.
