		Testpack provides utilities for both HUnit and QuickCheck.  These include
		tools for running QuickCheck properties as HUnit test cases, allowing you to
		combine both approaches in a single program.  It also includes tools for more
		helpful displays of running progress in both HUnit and QuickCheck, additional
		generators for other types for QuickCheck, and shortcuts for quickly defining new.
