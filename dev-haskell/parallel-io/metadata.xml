		This package provides combinators for sequencing IO actions onto a thread pool. The
		thread pool is guaranteed to contain no more unblocked threads than a user-specified upper limit, thus
		minimizing contention.
		
		Furthermore, the parallel combinators can be used reentrantly - your parallel
		actions can spawn more parallel actions - without violating this property of the thread pool.
		
		The package is inspired by the thread &lt;http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/56499/focus=56521&gt;.
		Thanks to Neil Mitchell and Bulat Ziganshin for some of the code this package is based on.
