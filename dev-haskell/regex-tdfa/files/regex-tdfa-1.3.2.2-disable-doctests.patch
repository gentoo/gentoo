doctests don't seem to work with Setup.hs

The hackage tarball doesn't include cabal.project which seems to be necessary
for doctest-parallel to work. Even when this file is copied to $S, Setup.hs
doesn't seem to recognize it.

The necessary flag is not recognized by `./setup configure`:
    --write-ghc-environment-files=always
See: <https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/3.4/cabal-project.html#cfg-field-write-ghc-environment-files>
