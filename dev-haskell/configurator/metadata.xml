	<longdescription>
		A configuration management library for programs and daemons.
		
		Features include:
		
		* Automatic, dynamic reloading in response to modifications to
		configuration files.
		
		* A simple, but flexible, configuration language, supporting several
		of the most commonly needed types of data, along with
		interpolation of strings from the configuration or the system
		environment (e.g. @$(HOME)@).
		
		* Subscription-based notification of changes to configuration
		properties.
		
		* An @import@ directive allows the configuration of a complex
		application to be split across several smaller files, or common
		configuration data to be shared across several applications.
		
		For details of the configuration file format, see
		&lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/configurator/latest/doc/html/Data-Configurator.html&gt;.
