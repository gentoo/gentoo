		The Lazy Virtual Machine (LVM) defines a portable instruction set and file
		format. It is specifically designed to execute languages with non-strict (or
		lazy) semantics. This cabal package defines the core assembler (coreasm) for
		compiling core programs into LVM instructions and a library. The LVM is used
		as a backend for the Helium compiler. At the moment, one LVM runtime
		implementation is available (written in C). More information about LVM can be
		found in Chapter 6 of Daan Leijen's PhD Thesis, The Lambda Abroad.
