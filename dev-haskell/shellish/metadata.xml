		The shellisg package provides a single module for convenient
		\&quot;systems\&quot; programming in Haskell, similar in spirit to POSIX
		shells or PERL.
		
		* Elegance and safety is sacrificed for conciseness and
		swiss-army-knife-ness.
		
		* The interface exported by Shellish is thread-safe.
		
		Overall, the module should help you to get a job done quickly,
		without getting too dirty.
