	<longdescription>
		Allows tests such as QuickCheck properties and HUnit test cases to be assembled into test groups, run in
		parallel (but reported in deterministic order, to aid diff interpretation) and filtered and controlled by
		command line options. All of this comes with colored test output, progress reporting and test statistics output.
