		Uniplate is library for writing simple and concise generic operations.
		Uniplate has similar goals to the original Scrap Your Boilerplate work,
		but is substantially simpler and faster. The Uniplate manual is available at
		&lt;http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/darcs/uniplate/uniplate.htm&gt;.
		
		To get started with Uniplate you should import one of the three following
		modules:
		
		* &quot;Data.Generics.Uniplate.Data&quot; - to quickly start writing generic functions.
		Most users should start by importing this module.
		
		* &quot;Data.Generics.Uniplate.Direct&quot; - a replacement for &quot;Data.Generics.Uniplate.Data&quot;
		with substantially higher performance (around 5 times), but requires writing
		instance declarations.
		
		* &quot;Data.Generics.Uniplate.Operations&quot; - definitions of all the operations defined
		by Uniplate. Both the above two modules re-export this module.
		
		In addition, some users may want to make use of the following modules:
		
		* &quot;Data.Generics.Uniplate.Zipper&quot; - a zipper built on top of Uniplate instances.
		
		* &quot;Data.Generics.SYB&quot; - users transitioning from the Scrap Your Boilerplate library.
		
		* &quot;Data.Generics.Compos&quot; - users transitioning from the Compos library.
		
		* &quot;Data.Generics.Uniplate.DataOnly&quot; - users making use of both @Data@ and @Direct@
		to avoid getting instance conflicts.
