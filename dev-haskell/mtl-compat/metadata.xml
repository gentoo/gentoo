		This package backports the "Control.Monad.Except" module from
		@mtl@ (if using @mtl-2.2.0.1@ or earlier), which reexports the
		@ExceptT@ monad transformer and the @MonadError@ class.
		
		This package should only be used if there is a need to use the
		@Control.Monad.Except@ module specifically. If you just want
		the @mtl@ class instances for @ExceptT@, use
		@transformers-compat@ instead, since @mtl-compat@ does nothing
		but reexport the instances from that package.
		
		Note that unlike how @mtl-2.2@ or later works, the
		"Control.Monad.Except" module defined in this package exports
		all of @ExceptT@'s monad class instances. Therefore, you may
		have to declare @import Control.Monad.Except ()@ at the top of
		your file to get all of the @ExceptT@ instances in scope.
