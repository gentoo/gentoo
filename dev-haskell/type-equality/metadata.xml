	<longdescription>
		In the presence of GADTs, sometimes a proof is
		needed that two types are equal. This package
		contains an equality type for this purpose, plus its
		properties (reflexive, symmetric, transitive) and
		some useful operations (substitution, congruence,
		coercion/cast). It also contains a type class for
		producing equality proofs, providing some form of
		decidable equality on types.
