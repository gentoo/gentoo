		@cabal-helper@ provides a library which wraps the internal use of executables
		to lift the restrictions imposed by linking against versions of GHC before
		@7.10@.
		
		@cabal-helper@ uses a wrapper executable to compile the actual cabal-helper
		executable at runtime while linking against an arbitrary version of
		Cabal. This runtime-compiled helper executable is then used to extract
		various bits and peices from Cabal\&#39;s on disk state (dist/setup-config)
		written by it&#39;s configure command.
		
		In addition to this the wrapper executable also supports installing any
		version of Cabal from hackage in case it cannot be found in any available
		package database. The wrapper installs these instances of the Cabal library
		into a private package database so as to not interfere with the user&#39;s
		packages.
		
		Furthermore the wrapper supports one special case namely reading a state
		file for Cabal itself. This is needed as Cabal compiles it&#39;s Setup.hs using
		itself and not using any version of Cabal installed in any package database.
		
		@cabal-helper@ can compile with @Cabal &gt;= 1.14@ but requires @Cabal &gt;= 1.16@
		at runtime.
