		Unite searches and displays information from arbitrary sources like files,
		buffers, recently used files or registers. You can run one of defined action
		on a target displayed.

		The differences between unite and similar plugins like fuzzyfinder or ku are
		that unite doesn't use the built-in completion interface of Vim, and integrates
		sources at the same time.
