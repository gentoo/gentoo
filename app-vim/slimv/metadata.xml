		Slimv tries to mimic a subset of SLIME's (Superior Lisp Interaction Mode
		for Emacs) functionality inside Vim. The script defines functions and
		keybindings to send s-expressions to a console mode Lisp or Clojure REPL
		(Read-Eval-Print Loop).
		
		Slimv runs its own REPL or connects to a running REPL started by a
		previous Slimv session, the connection is established when the first
		Slimv command is executed (e.g. an s-expression is evaluated). The Lisp
		REPL buffer can also be opened inside Vim as a Vim buffer with syntax
		highlighting and autoindenting, Lisp commands may be entered in the
		command line, just as in a regular REPL. The script also has a basic
		support for Clojure REPL. 

		The script also supports a number of other features provided by SLIME
		including profiling, paredit mode, and hyperspec lookups.
