	<longdescription>
	JWM is a light-weight window manager for the X11 Window System. JWM is
	written in C and uses only Xlib at a minimum. Because of its small
	footprint, JWM makes a good window manager for older computers and less
	powerful systems, such as the Raspberry Pi, though it is perfectly capable
	of running on modern systems. JWM is included in small Linux distributions
	such as Puppy Linux and Damn Small Linux, and it is available as a separate
	package in many other distributions.
