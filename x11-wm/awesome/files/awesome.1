.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBawesome\fP is a window manager for X. It manages windows in different layouts, like
floating or tiled. Any layout can be applied dynamically, optimizing the
environment for the application in use and the task currently being performed.
.sp
In a tiled layout, windows are managed in a master and stacking area. The master
area contains the windows which currently need the most attention, whereas the
stacking area contains all other windows. In a floating layout windows can be
resized and moved freely. Dialog windows are always managed as floating,
regardless of the layout currently applied. The spiral and dwindle layouts are
special cases of the tiled layout where the stacking area is arranged in a
spiral for the former or as a rectangular fractal for the later.
.sp
Windows are grouped by tags in awesome. Each window can be tagged with one or
more tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with these tags.
.sp
\fBawesome\fP can contain small wiboxes which can display anything you want:
all available tags, the current layout, the title of the visible windows, text, etc.
