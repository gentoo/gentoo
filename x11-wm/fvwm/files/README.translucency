Here a new version of the patch for current cvs/snapshot.
This patch add a new options to Colorset: Translucent/NoTranslucent.
These options has effects only with (non tear-off) menu.
Also menu animation is "handled".

For example with:

  Colorset 5 fg yellow, bg blue, HGradient 200 lightblue darkblue, \
	  Translucent blue 60
  Style * MenuColorset 5, PopupOffset 0 100, AnimationOff

you get translucent menus (with a 60% blue tint) and if you tear-off
a menu the menu use the gradient.

Regards, Olivier
