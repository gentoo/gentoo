    Enlightenment is classed as a "desktop shell" as it provides everything you need to 
    operate your desktop or laptop, but it is not a full application suite. This covers 
    functionality including launching applications, managing their windows and performing 
    system tasks like suspending, rebooting, managing files and so on.
