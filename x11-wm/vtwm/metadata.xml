	VTWM, one of many TWM descendants, implements a Virtual
	Desktop, meaning that what is currently on screen is just a portion of a
	larger workspace. What portion of the virtual desktop that is displayed,
	and whatever windows might be visible within it, are simple
	point-and-click operations within a scaled representation of the
	workspace.
