<longdescription>VTWM, one of many TWM descendants, implements a Virtual
  Desktop, meaning that what is currently on screen is just a portion of a
  larger workspace. What portion of the virtual desktop that is displayed,
  and whatever windows might be visible within it, are simple
  point-and-click operations within a scaled representation of the
  workspace.</longdescription>
