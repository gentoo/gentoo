		xmonad is a tiling window manager for X. Windows are arranged
		automatically to tile the screen without gaps or overlap, maximising
		screen use. All features of the window manager are accessible from
		the keyboard: a mouse is strictly optional. xmonad is written and
		extensible in Haskell. Custom layout algorithms, and other
		extensions, may be written by the user in config files. Layouts are
		applied dynamically, and different layouts may be used on each
		workspace. Xinerama is fully supported, allowing windows to be tiled
		on several screens.
