	aewm is a minimalist window manager for X11. It has no nifty features, 
	but is light on resources and extremely simple in appearance. It should 
	eventually make a good reference implementation of the ICCCM. A few 
	separate programs are included to handle running programs, switching 
	between windows, etc.
