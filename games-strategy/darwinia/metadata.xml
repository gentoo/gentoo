		The world of Darwinia is a virtual themepark, running entirely inside a computer network
		and populated by a sentient evolving life form called the Darwinians.

		Unfortunately Darwinia has been overrun by a computer virus which has multiplied out of control.
		Your task is to destroy the Viral Infection and save the Darwinians from extinction.
