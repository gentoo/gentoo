GalaxyHack allows you to design a fleet of spaceships which can then be tested
in AI script based battles against fleets designed by other players. Though
battles take place in real time, the strategy comes before hand, both in
writing short AI scripts in a simple scripting language, and also in the set up
and selection of your fleet. You don't actually have any control over your
units at all mid-battle, but rather use the time to see where the set up of
your fleets is working, where your fleets' weaknesses lie and changes are
needed, and perhaps also to learn from the strategy of your opponent.

The game revolves around very large capital ships, from which smaller ships are
launched, but which are not designed for attacking themselves, and which cannot
be moved mid-battle. To win a battle you must destroy of all of your opponent's
capital ships before they destroy yours.

There can be hundreds of units in any one battle, but there is no harvesting,
resource management or base building.
