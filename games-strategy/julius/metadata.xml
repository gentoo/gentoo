		The aim of this project is to create an open-source version of
		Caesar 3, with the same logic as the original, but with some UI
		enhancements, that is able to be played on multiple platforms.
		The same logic means that the saved games are 100% compatible,
		and any gameplay bugs present in the original Caesar 3 game will
		also be present in Julius. It is meant as a drop-in replacement
		for Caesar 3, with the same look and feel, so there will be no
		major UI changes.
