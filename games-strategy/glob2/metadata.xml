Globulation2 is an innovative high quality Real-Time Strategy [RTS], 
which minimizes micro-management by automatically assigning tasks to 
the units. The player has to choose the number of units he wants for 
the different tasks, and the units will do their best to satisfy the 
requests. This allows to manage more units and to focus on strategies.
