		Dune Legacy is an effort by a handful of developers to revitalize
		the first-ever real-time strategy game. The original game was the
		basis for the hugely successful Command and Conquer series, and the
		gameplay has been replicated an extended to a wide variety of
		storylines and series.

		Lead one of three interplanetary houses, Atreides, Harkonnen or
		Ordos, in an attempt to harvest the largest amount of spice from
		the sand dunes. Exchange your spice stockpiles for credits through
		refinement and build an army capable of thwarting attempts of the
		other houses to stop your harvesting!
