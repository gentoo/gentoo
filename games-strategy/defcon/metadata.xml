		You play the role of a military Commander hidden deep within an Underground bunker.
		Your mission - to successfully exterminate your enemy's civilian population whilst
		disabling their ability to attack your own. Start by launching your battleships,
		subs and bombers in order to decimate your opponent's defences.
		Scramble together your alliances but remember only one can stand victorious.

		Prepare your pre-emptive strike before one of your supposed allies gets the same idea.
		Choose the perfect moment for betrayal, obliterating your opponents with an apocalyptic
		thermonuclear barrage, but get it wrong and their devastating counter attack will bring you to your knees!
