Outer Space is an on-line strategy game which takes place in the dangerous
universe. You will become powerful commander of many stars, planets, and great
fleets and will struggle for survival with other commanders.

Outer Space communicates with the server in the same way as your browser, but
you will need a special client to play it. Using this client you can create an
account on the server and you can start to explore the world of the Outer Space.
