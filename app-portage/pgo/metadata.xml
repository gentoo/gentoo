		pgo is a small command line interface for packages.gentoo.org. It is
		using the graphql api of packages.gentoo.org to display information
		about packages like: versions, metadata, dependencies, QA reports,
		pull requests, bugs and the changelog. It's also able to display
		information for maintainers, as a list of packages they are maintaining,
		a list of outdated packages, or bugs related to the packages they are
		maintaining.
