  The COIN-OR Stochastic Modeling Interface (SMI) is an interface for
  problems in which uncertainty and optimization appear
  together. There are many modeling and algorithmic approaches that
  could belong here, like: recourse programming, chance constrained
  programming, stochastic control and dynamic programming, robust
  optimization, etc, etc. SMI is intended to be like OSI in the sense
  that an SmiXX object is an implementation derived from a base class
  that takes care of a number of commonly encountered programming
  issues, like handling probability distributions, managing problem
  generation, interacting with solvers to obtain solution information,
  etc.
