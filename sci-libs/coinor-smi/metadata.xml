		The COIN-OR Stochastic Modeling Interface (SMI) is an interface for
		problems in which uncertainty and optimization appear
		together. There are many modeling and algorithmic approaches that
		could belong here, like: recourse programming, chance constrained
		programming, stochastic control and dynamic programming, robust
		optimization, etc, etc. SMI is intended to be like OSI in the sense
		that an SmiXX object is an implementation derived from a base class
		that takes care of a number of commonly encountered programming
		issues, like handling probability distributions, managing problem
		generation, interacting with solvers to obtain solution information,
		etc.
