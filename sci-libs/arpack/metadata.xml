  The ARnoldi PACKage is a library of routines capable of solving large scale symmetric,
  nonsymmetric, and generalized eigenproblems. The software is designed to compute a few
  eigenvalues with user specified features such as those of largest real
  part or largest magnitude. Storage requirements are on the order of
  n*k locations. No auxiliary storage is required. A set of Schur basis
  vectors for the desired k-dimensional eigen-space is computed which is
  numerically orthogonal to working precision. Numerically accurate
  eigenvectors are available on request.
