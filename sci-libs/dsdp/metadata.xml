  The DSDP software is a free open source implementation of an
  interior-point method for semidefinite programming. It provides
  primal and dual solutions, exploits low-rank structure and sparsity
  in the data, and has relatively low memory requirements for an
  interior-point method. It allows feasible and infeasible starting
  points and provides approximate certificates of infeasibility when
  no feasible solution exists. The dual-scaling algorithm implemented
  in this package has a convergence proof and worst-case polynomial
  complexity under mild assumptions on the data. Furthermore, the
  solver offers scalable parallel performance for large problems and a
  well documented interface. Some of the most popular applications of
  semidefinite programming and linear matrix inequalities (LMI) are
  model control, truss topology design, and semidefinite relaxations
  of combinatorial and global optimization problems.
