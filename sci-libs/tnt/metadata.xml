  The Template Numerical Toolkit (TNT) is a collection of interfaces and 
  reference implementations of numerical objects useful for scientific 
  computing in C++. The toolkit defines interfaces for basic data 
  structures, such as multidimensional arrays and sparse matrices, commonly 
  used in numerical applications. The goal of this package is to provide
  reusable software components that address many of the portability and 
  maintenance problems with C++ codes.
