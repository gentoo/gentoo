  DyLp is designed to find solutions of constrained linear mathematical
  optimization problems. To this end, it is using a full implementation
  of the so called dynamic simplex algorithm for linear programming.
  DyLP is part of the larger COIN-OR initiative (Computational
  Infrastructure for Operations Research).
