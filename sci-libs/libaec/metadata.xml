 Libaec provides fast lossless compression of 1 up to 32 bit wide
 signed or unsigned integers (samples). The library achieves best
 results for low entropy data as often encountered in space imaging
 instrument data or numerical model output from weather or climate
 simulations. While floating point representations are not directly
 supported, they can also be efficiently coded by grouping exponents
 and mantissa.
