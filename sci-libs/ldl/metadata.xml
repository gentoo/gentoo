<longdescription lang="en">
  LDL is a set of concise routines for factorizing symmetric
  positive-definite sparse matrices, with some applicability to
  symmetric indefinite matrices. Its primary purpose is to illustrate
  much of the basic theory of sparse matrix algorithms in as concise a
  code as possible, including an elegant new method of sparse symmetric
  factorization that computes the factorization row-by-row but stores it
  column-by-column. The entire symbolic and numeric factorization
  consists of a total of only 49 lines of code. The package is written
  in C, and includes a MATLAB interface.
