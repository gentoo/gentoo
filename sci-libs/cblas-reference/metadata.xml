The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are high quality "building
block" routines for performing basic vector and matrix operations. Level 1
BLAS do vector-vector operations, Level 2 BLAS do matrix-vector operations,
and Level 3 BLAS do matrix-matrix operations. Because the BLAS are
efficient, portable, and widely available, they're commonly used in the
development of high quality linear algebra software, LAPACK for
example. This packages implements the reference C library as a wrapper
to the FORTRAN 77 BLAS library.
