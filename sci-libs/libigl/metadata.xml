		ibigl is a simple C++ geometry processing library with a wide functionality including construction of sparse
		discrete differential geometry operators and finite-elements matrices such as the cotangent Laplacian and
		diagonalized mass matrix, simple facet and edge-based topology data structures, mesh-viewing utilities for
		OpenGL and GLSL, and many core functions for matrix manipulation which make Eigen feel a lot more like MATLAB.
