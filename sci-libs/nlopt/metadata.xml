  NLopt is a library for nonlinear optimization,
  providing a common interface for a number of different free
  optimization routines available online as well as original
  implementations of various other algorithms. Its features include:
    * Callable from variety of languages (C, C++, Fortran, Python, Octave)
    * A common interface for many different algorithmsâ€”try a different
    algorithm just by changing one parameter.
    * Both global and local optimization algorithms.
    * Both derivative-free and gradient-based optimization algorithms.
    * Algorithms for unconstrained optimization, bound-constrained
    optimization, and general nonlinear inequality constraints.
