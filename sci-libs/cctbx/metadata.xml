	The Computational Crystallography Toolbox (cctbx) is being developed
	as the open source component of the PHENIX system. The goal of
	the PHENIX project is to advance automation of macromolecular structure
	determination. PHENIX depends on the cctbx, but not vice versa. This
	hierarchical approach enforces a clean design as a reusable library.
	The cctbx is therefore also useful for small-molecule crystallography
	and even general scientific applications.
