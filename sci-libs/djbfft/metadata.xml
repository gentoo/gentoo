  D.J. Bernstein Fast Fourier Transform (djbfft) is an extremely 
  fast library for floating-point convolution. The current version
  holds most of the speed records for double-precision FFTs on
  general-purpose computers.
  djbfft provides power-of-2 complex FFTs, real FFTs at twice the speed,
  and fast multiplication of complex arrays. Single precision and double
  precision are equally supported.
