It can be used from within compiled languages such as C, C++, FORTRAN and Java, as well as interactively from interpreted languages such as Octave, Python, Perl and Tcl. It is capable of producing standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D surface plots, mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts. Multiple graphs may be composited, and it also supports a large variety of output file devices such as Postscript, PNG, JPEG, LaTeX and others.
