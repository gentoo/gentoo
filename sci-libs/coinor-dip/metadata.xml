  DIP (Decomposition for Integer Programming) is an open-source
  extensible software framework for implementing decomposition-based
  bounding algorithms for use in solving large-scale discrete
  optimization problems. The framework provides a simple API for
  experimenting with various decomposition-based algorithms, such as
  Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition, Lagrangian relaxation, and various
  cutting plane methods.
