	#   --with-ntl: used for finite field, polynomial arithmetic (optional)
	#   --with-iml: used for fast integer/rational linear algebra (optional)
	#   --with-mpfr: not sure, doesn't seem to be used? (optional)
	#   --with-flint: used in algorithms/matrix-blas3 once (optional)
	#   --with-fplll: an fplll interface not directly used (optional)
	#   --with-doxygen: needed with --enable-doc to build them (optional)

	# Some of these could be behind USE flags, but the ./configure output
	# says that they're "not yet mandatory," which makes me think we might
	# be overcomplicating things to make them optional right now.
