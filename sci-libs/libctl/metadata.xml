  libctl is the Control Language library implementing a control file
  structure aimed at simplifying the control file writing in
  scientific simulations.  The "ctl" in "libctl" stands for Control
  Language (by convention, libctl  control files end with ".ctl" and
  are referred to as ctl files).
