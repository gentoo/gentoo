  PaStiX (Parallel Sparse matriX package) is a scientific library that
  provides a high performance parallel solver for very large sparse
  linear systems based on direct methods.  Numerical algorithms are
  implemented in single or double precision (real or complex) using
  LLt, LDLt and LU with static pivoting (for non symmetric matrices
  having a symmetric pattern).  This solver provides also an adaptive
  blockwise iLU(k) factorization that can be used as a parallel
  preconditioner using approximated supernodes to build a coarser
  block structure of the incomplete factors.
