  IT++ is a C++ library of mathematical, signal processing and
  communication classes and functions. Its main use is in simulation
  of communication systems and for performing research in the area of
  communications. The kernel of the library consists of generic vector
  and matrix classes, and a set of accompanying routines. Such a
  kernel makes IT++ similar to MATLAB or GNU Octave .
