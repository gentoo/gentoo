		SPEX is a software package comprising several state-of-the-art 
		SParse EXact linear algebra routines. It currently is comprised
		of the following:
		*Utility and auxiliary functions for all SPEX routines:
		interface to the GMP/MPFR library, memory management 
		functions, the SPEX_matrix data structure, and various
		functions that are auxiliary to the factorization and solve
		functions
		*Sparse exact left-looking LU factorization to solve the
		linear system Ax=B. The solution time is proportional to the 
		arithmetic work in the bit-complexity model; this is an 
		asymptotically efficient complexity bound.
