  MPFIT uses the Levenberg-Marquardt technique to solve the
  least-squares problem. In its typical use, MPFIT will be used to fit
  a user-supplied function (the "model") to user-supplied data points
  (the "data") by adjusting a set of parameters. MPFIT is based upon
  MINPACK-1 (LMDIF.F) by More' and collaborators.
