  SCOTCH is a software package and libraries for graph, mesh and
  hypergraph partitioning, static mapping, and sparse matrix block
  ordering.
  Its purpose of Scotch is to apply graph theory, with a divide and
  conquer approach, to scientific computing problems such as graph and
  mesh partitioning, static mapping, and sparse matrix ordering, in
  application domains ranging from structural mechanics to operating
  systems or bio-chemistry.
  The SCOTCH distribution is a set of programs and libraries which
  implement the static mapping and sparse matrix reordering algorithms
  developed within the SCOTCH project.
