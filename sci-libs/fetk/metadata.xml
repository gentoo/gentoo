The Finite Element ToolKit (FETK) is a collaboratively developed, evolving 
collection of adaptive finite element method (AFEM) software libraries and 
tools for solving coupled systems of nonlinear geometric partial differential 
equations (PDE). The FETK libraries and tools are written in an 
object-oriented form of ANSI-C and in C++, and include a common portability 
layer (MALOC) for all of FETK, a collection of standard numerical 
libraries (PUNC), a stand-alone high-quality surface and volume simplex mesh 
generator (GAMer), a stand-alone networked polygon display tool (SG), 
a general nonlinear finite element modeling kernel (MC), 
and a MATLAB toolkit (MCLite) for protyping finite element methods and 
examining simplex meshes using MATLAB. The entire FETK Suite of tools is 
highly portable (from iPhone to Blue Gene/L), thanks to use of 
a small abstraction layer (MALOC).
