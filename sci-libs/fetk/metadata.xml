  The Finite Element ToolKit (FETK) is a collaboratively developed, evolving
  collection of adaptive finite element method (AFEM) software libraries and
  tools for solving coupled systems of nonlinear geometric partial differential
  equations (PDE). The FETK libraries and tools are written in an
  object-oriented form of ANSI-C and in C++, and include a common portability
  layer (MALOC) for all of FETK, a collection of standard numerical
  libraries (PUNC), a stand-alone high-quality surface and volume simplex mesh
  generator (GAMer), a stand-alone networked polygon display tool (SG),
  a general nonlinear finite element modeling kernel (MC),
  and a MATLAB toolkit (MCLite) for protyping finite element methods and
  examining simplex meshes using MATLAB. The entire FETK Suite of tools is
  highly portable (from iPhone to Blue Gene/L), thanks to use of
  a small abstraction layer (MALOC).
