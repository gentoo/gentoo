  SPOOLES is a library for solving sparse real and complex linear
  systems of equations, written in the C language using object
  oriented design. At present, there is the following functionality:
  1. Compute multiple minimum degree, generalized nested dissection
     and multisection orderings of matrices with symmetric structure.
  2. Factor and solve square linear systems of equations with
     symmetric structure, with or without pivoting for stability.
  3. Factor and solve overdetermined full rank systems of equations
     using a multifrontal QR factorization.
  4. Solve square linear systems using a variety of Krylov iterative
     methods. The preconditioner is a drop tolerance factorization,
     with or without pivoting for stability.
