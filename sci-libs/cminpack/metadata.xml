<longdescription lang="en">
  Minpack includes software for solving nonlinear equations and
  nonlinear least squares problems. Five algorithmic paths each
  include a core subroutine and an easy-to-use driver. The algorithms
  proceed either from an analytic specification of the Jacobian matrix
  or directly from the problem functions. The paths include facilities
  for systems of equations with a banded Jacobian matrix, for least
  squares problems with a large amount of data, and for checking the
  consistency of the Jacobian matrix with the functions.
  This is the C re-write of the original fortran minpack
  implementation.
