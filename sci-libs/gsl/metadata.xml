  The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a collection of routines for
  numerical analysis. The routines are written from scratch by the GSL
  team in C, and present a modern API for C programmers, while allowing
  wrappers to be written for very high level languages.
  
  GSL includes data types and routines for complex numbers, vectors,
  matrices, basic linear algebra subroutines (BLAS), eigensystems,
  simulated annealing, minimization, root finding, pseudo-random
  numbers, least-squares fitting, fast Fourier transforms (FFT),
  differential equations, quadrature, Monte Carlo integration, special
  functions, physical constants, and much more.
