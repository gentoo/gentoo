		Minuit provides a C++ library for non-linear optimization,
		and parameter error estimation. Widely used in High Energy Physics,
		originally as a fortran library, it has been entirely re-written from
		scratch in C++. It is now included in ROOT-5 and higher.
		This is the stand-alone version, quick to build and use.
