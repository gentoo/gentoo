<longdescription lang="en">
  Minuit provides a C++ library for non-linear optimization,
  and parameter error estimation. Widely used in High Energy Physics,
  originally as a fortran library, it has been entirely re-written from
  scratch in C++. It is now included in ROOT-5 and higher. 
  This is the stand-alone version, quick to build and use.
