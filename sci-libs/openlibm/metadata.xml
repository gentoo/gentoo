  <longdescription lang="en">
OpenLibm is an effort to have a high quality, portable, standalone C
mathematical library (libm). It can be used standalone in applications
and programming language implementations.
The project was born out of a need to have a good libm for the Julia
programming langage that worked consistently across compilers and
operating systems, and in 32-bit and 64-bit environments.
