  The Genetic Algorithm Utility Library is a
  flexible programming library designed to aid in the development of
  applications that use genetic, or evolutionary, algorithms. It
  provides data structures and functions for handling and manipulation
  of the data required for serial and parallel evolutionary
  algorithms. Additional stochastic algorithms are provided for
  comparison to the genetic algorithms. Much of the functionality is
  also available through a simple S-Lang interface.
