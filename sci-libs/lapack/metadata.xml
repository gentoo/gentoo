The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are high quality "building
block" routines for performing basic vector and matrix operations. Level 1
BLAS do vector-vector operations, Level 2 BLAS do matrix-vector operations,
and Level 3 BLAS do matrix-matrix operations. Because the BLAS are
efficient, portable, and widely available, they're commonly used in the
development of high quality linear algebra software, LAPACK for
example. This packages implements the reference FORTRAN 77 library,
the reference C library as a wrapper to the FORTRAN 77 BLAS library.

LAPACK is a comprehensive library that does linear algebra
operations including matrix inversions, least squared solutions to
linear sets of equations, eigenvector analysis, singular value
decomposition, etc. It is a very comprehensive and reputable package
that has found extensive use in the scientific community.
This package installs the reference FORTRAN 77 implementation from Netlib.
