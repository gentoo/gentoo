  The Consultative Committee on Space Data Systems (CCSDS) has adopted
  the extended-Rice algorithm for international standards for space
  applications. Szip is reported to provide fast and effective
  compression, specifically for the EOS data generated by the NASA
  Earth Observatory System (EOS). It was originally developed at
  University of New Mexico (UNM) and integrated with HDF4 by UNM
  researchers and developers. It can be used for HDF 5 as well.
