  The Core Library is a collection of C/C++ classes for exact
  computation with real algebraic numbers.
  It embodies our precision-driven approach and is 
  useful for robust numerical (especially geometric) algorithms.
  The library supports the Exact Geometric Computation (EGC)
  philosophy through its novel and easy-to-use notion of accuracy
  levels.
