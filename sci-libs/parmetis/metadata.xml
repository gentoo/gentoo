  ParMETIS is an MPI-based parallel library that implements a variety
  of algorithms for partitioning unstructured graphs and for computing
  fill-reducing orderings of sparse matrices. ParMETIS extends the
  functionality provided by METIS and includes routines that are
  especially suited for parallel AMR computations and large scale
  numerical simulations.
