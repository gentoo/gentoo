		DEAP stands for Distributed Evolutionary Algorithm in Python, it is dedicated to people who
		wish to learn how to use evolutionary algorithms and to those who wish to
		rediscover evolutionary algorithms. DEAP is the proof that evolutionary
		algorithms do **not** need to be neither complex or complicated.
