    DEAP stands for Distributed Evolutionary Algorithm in Python, it is dedicated to people who
	wish to learn how to use evolutionary algorithms and to those who wish to
	rediscover evolutionary algorithms. DEAP is the proof that evolutionary 
	algorithms do **not** need to be neither complex or complicated.
