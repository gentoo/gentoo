	PUNC (Portable Understructure for Numerical Computing) is a small standard
	collection of software libraries for numerical computing. The PUNC
	collection includes reference implementations of the standard (dense matrix)
	linear algebra tools BLAS and LAPACK, and also includes some newer (sparse
	matrix) linear algebra tools ARPACK, SuperLU, CgCode, and PMG. PUNC also 
	provides some additional basic infrastructure such as the standard F2C 
	header and corresponding library (libF2C), to support the use of F2C'd 
	FORTRAN codes, and some other standard tools used to build numerical 
	simulation software, such as the HDF5 library. While most of the libraries 
	included in PUNC are completely stand-alone, and are the reference 
	implementations developed by the individual library authors, PUNC also 
	provides some Object-oriented C wrappers (written by the FETK developers) 
	for use with Object-oriented C/C++ codes such as FETK . This is accomplished
	by building PUNC on top of FETK 's MALOC library.
