   CSDP is a library of routines that implements a predictor corrector
   variant of the semidefinite programming algorithm of Helmberg,
   Rendl, Vanderbei, and Wolkowicz. The main advantages of this code
   are that it is written to be used as a callable subroutine, it is
   written in C for efficiency, the code runs in parallel on shared
   memory multi-processor systems, and it makes effective use of
   sparsity in the constraint matrices. CSDP has been compiled on many
   different systems. The code should work on any system with an ANSI
   C Compiler and BLAS/LAPACK libraries.
