  MPFI is intended to be a portable library written in C for arbitrary
  precision interval arithmetic with intervals represented using MPFR
  reliable floating-point numbers. It is based on the GNU MP library
  and on the MPFR library. The purpose of an arbitrary precision
  interval arithmetic is on the one hand to get guaranteed results,
  thanks to interval computation, and on the other hand to obtain
  accurate results, thanks to multiple precision arithmetic. The MPFI
  library is built upon MPFR in order to benefit from the correct
  roundings provided by MPFR. Further advantages of using MPFR are its
  portability and compliance with the IEEE 754 standard for
  floating-point arithmetic.
