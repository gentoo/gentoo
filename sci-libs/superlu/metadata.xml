  SuperLU is a general purpose library for the direct solution of large,
  sparse, nonsymmetric systems of linear equations on high performance
  machines. The library is written in C and is callable from either C or
  Fortran. The library routines will perform an LU decomposition with
  partial pivoting and triangular system solves through forward and back
  substitution. The LU factorization routines can handle non-square
  matrices but the triangular solves are performed only for square
  matrices. The matrix columns may be preordered (before factorization)
  either through library or user supplied routines. This preordering for
  sparsity is completely separate from the factorization. Working
  precision iterative refinement subroutines are provided for improved
  backward stability. Routines are also provided to equilibrate the
  system, estimate the condition number, calculate the relative backward
  error, and estimate error bounds for the refined solutions.
