  <longdescription lang="en">
    FFLAS-FFPACK is a library for basic linear algebra operations over
    a finite field. It is inspired by the BLAS interface (Basic Linear
    Algebra Subprograms) and the LAPACK library for numerical linear
    algebra, and shares part of their design. Yet it differs in many
    aspects due to the specifics of computing over a finite field: it
    is generic with respect to the finite field, so as to accommodate
    a large variety of field sizes and implementations; consequently,
    all routines use C++ template generics and the library is
    primarily meant to be used as a source code library, to be
    included and compiled in the user's software.
