	SHOGUN - is a new machine learning toolbox with focus on large
	scale kernel methods and especially on Support Vector Machines
	(SVM) with focus to bioinformatics. It provides a generic SVM
	object interfacing to several different SVM implementations. Each
	of the SVMs can be combined with a variety of the many kernels
	implemented. It can deal with weighted linear combination of a
	number of sub-kernels, each of which not necessarily working on the
	same domain, where	an optimal sub-kernel weighting can be learned
	using Multiple Kernel Learning.	Apart from SVM 2-class
	classification and regression problems, a number of linear methods
	like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Linear Programming Machine
	(LPM), (Kernel) Perceptrons and also algorithms to train hidden
	markov models are implemented. The input feature-objects can be
	dense, sparse or strings and of type int/short/double/char and can
	be converted into different feature types. Chains of preprocessors
	(e.g. substracting the mean) can be attached to each feature object
	allowing for on-the-fly pre-processing.
