  SHOGUN - is a new machine learning toolbox with focus on large
  scale kernel methods and especially on Support Vector Machines
  (SVM) with focus to bioinformatics. It provides a generic SVM
  object interfacing to several different SVM implementations. Each
  of the SVMs can be combined with a variety of the many kernels
  implemented. It can deal with weighted linear combination of a
  number of sub-kernels, each of which not necessarily working on the
  same domain, where  an optimal sub-kernel weighting can be learned
  using Multiple Kernel Learning.  Apart from SVM 2-class
  classification and regression problems, a number of linear methods
  like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Linear Programming Machine
  (LPM), (Kernel) Perceptrons and also algorithms to train hidden
  markov models are implemented. The input feature-objects can be
  dense, sparse or strings and of type int/short/double/char and can
  be converted into different feature types. Chains of preprocessors
  (e.g. substracting the mean) can be attached to each feature object
  allowing for on-the-fly pre-processing.
