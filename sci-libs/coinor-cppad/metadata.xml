  We refer to the step by step conversion from an algorithm that
  computes function values to an algorithm that computes derivative
  values as Algorithmic Differentiation (AD); often referred to as
  automatic differentiation. Given a C++ algorithm that computes
  function values, CppAD generates an algorithm that computes
  corresponding derivative values (of arbitrary order using either
  forward or reverse mode).
