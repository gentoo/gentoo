MPIR is an open source multiprecision integer (bignum) library forked
from the GMP (GNU Multi Precision) project. It consists of much code
from past GMP releases, in combination with much original contributed
code.

MPIR is constructed by a developer and vendor friendly community of
professional and amateur mathematicians, computer scientists and
hobbyists.
