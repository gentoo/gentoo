  <longdescription lang="en">
    Armadillo is a C++ linear algebra library (matrix maths) aiming
    towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. Integer,
    floating point and complex numbers are supported, as well as a
    subset of trigonometric and statistics functions. Various matrix
    decompositions are provided through optional integration with LAPACK
    and ATLAS libraries. 
    A delayed evaluation approach is employed (during compile time) to
    combine several operations into one and reduce (or eliminate) the
    need for temporaries. This is accomplished through recursive
    templates and template meta-programming.
