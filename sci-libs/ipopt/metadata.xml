  Ipopt is a solver for large-scale nonlinear continuous
  optimization. It can be used from modeling environments, such as
  AMPL, GAMS, or Matlab, and it is also available as a callable library with
  interfaces to C++, C, and Fortran. Ipopt uses an interior point
  method, together with a filter linear search procedure. Ipopt is
  part of the larger COIN-OR initiative (Computational Infrastructure
  for Operations Research).
