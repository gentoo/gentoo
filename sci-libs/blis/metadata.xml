  <longdescription>
    BLIS is a portable software framework for instantiating high-performance
    BLAS-like dense linear algebra libraries. The framework was designed to
    isolate essential kernels of computation that, when optimized, immediately
    enable optimized implementations of most of its commonly used and
    computationally intensive operations. BLIS is written in ISO C99 and
    available under a new/modified/3-clause BSD license. While BLIS exports a
    new BLAS-like API, it also includes a BLAS compatibility layer which gives
    application developers access to BLIS implementations via traditional BLAS
    routine calls. An object-based API unique to BLIS is also available.
