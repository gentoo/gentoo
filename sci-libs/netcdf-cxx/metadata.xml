  NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is an interface for scientific
  data access and a freely-distributed software library that provides an
  implementation of the interface.  The netCDF library also defines a
  machine-independent format for representing scientific data.
  Together, the interface, library, and format support the creation,
  access, and sharing of scientific data.
  This is the C++ library which links to the C library.
