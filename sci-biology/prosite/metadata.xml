		A protein families and domains database maintained at the Swiss
		Institude for Bioinformatics. It consists of biologically significant
		sites, patterns and profiles that help to reliably identify to which
		known protein family (if any) a new sequence belongs. PROSITE currently
		contains patterns and profiles specific for more than a thousand
		protein families or domains. Each of these signatures comes with
		documentation providing background information on the structure and
		function of these proteins.
