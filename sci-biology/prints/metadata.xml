		A protein motif fingerprint database maintained at the University of
		Manchester. A fingerprint is a group of conserved motifs used to
		characterise a protein family; its diagnostic power is refined by
		iterative scanning of a SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL composite. Usually the motifs
		do not overlap, but are separated along a sequence, though they may be
		contiguous in 3D-space. Fingerprints can encode protein folds and
		functionalities more flexibly and powerfully than can single motifs,
		full diagnostic potency deriving from the mutual context provided by
		motif neighbours.
