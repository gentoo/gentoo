		Amino acid indices and similarity matrices maintained at Kyoto
		University. An amino acid index is a set of 20 numerical values
		representing any of the different physicochemical and biological
		properties of amino acids.  The AAindex1 section of the Amino Acid
		Index Database is a collection of published indices together with the
		result of cluster analysis using the correlation coefficient as the
		distance between two indices.  This section currently contains 494
		indices. Another important feature of amino acids that can be
		represented numerically is the similarity between amino acids.  Thus, a
		similarity matrix, also called a mutation matrix, is a set of 210
		numerical values, 20 diagonal and 20x19/2 off-diagonal elements, used
		for sequence alignments and similarity searches.  The AAindex2 section
		of the Amino Acid Index Database is a collection of published amino
		acid mutation matrices together with the result of cluster analysis.
		This section currently contains 83 matrices.
