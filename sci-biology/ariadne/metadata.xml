		ARIADNE is a package of two programs, ariadne and prospero, that
		compare protein sequences and profiles using the Smith-Waterman
		algorithm, and assesses statistical significance using a new accurate
		formula, described in Mott, 2000, "Accurate Formula for P-values of
		gapped local sequence and profile alignments" J. Mol Biol. 300:649-659.
		The sequence/profile comparison algorithms used in ARIADNE are
		standard, and are probably not the fastest implementations available.
		The novel part is the method for determining statistical significance,
		which will give thresholds of significance that are accurate to within
		5% 95% of the time.
