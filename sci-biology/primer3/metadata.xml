		Primer3 picks primers for PCR reactions, considering: oligonucleotide
		melting temperature, size, GC content, and primer-dimer possibilities;
		PCR product size; positional constraints within the source sequence;
		and miscellaneous other constraints. All of these criteria are
		user-specifiable as constraints, and some are specifiable as terms in
		an objective function that characterizes an optimal primer pair.
