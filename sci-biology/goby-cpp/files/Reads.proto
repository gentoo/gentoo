     Stores meta-data about the reads. Typically meta-data is stored in the very first read of a
     read collection, with the understanding that the meta-data applies to all the reads in the
     collection. Meta-data can be used to store information about when the sample was sequenced,
     or other information of interest. The key-value pair format is sufficiently flexible to
     accomodate a variety of needs. The following keys are pre-defined. Please use pre-defined
     keys so that automated tools can use metadata in relatively standard way. Please note that
     some keys provide a format for the value. This format should also be followed to garantee
     that meta data can be used computationally in fully automatic manner.

     key="sequencing-run-start-date" value="MM/DD/YYYY" Used to record when the sequencing run
     was initiated on the instrument. Can be used to detect batch effect in a large set of samples.
