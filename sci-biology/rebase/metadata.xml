		The Restriction Enzyme data BASE is a collection of information about
		restriction enzymes and related proteins. It is maintained by New
		England Biolabs. It contains published and unpublished references,
		recognition and cleavage sites, isoschizomers, commercial availability,
		methylation sensitivity, crystal and sequence data. DNA
		methyltransferases, homing endonucleases, nicking enzymes, specificity
		subunits and control proteins are also included. More recently,
		putative DNA methyltransferases and restriction enzymes, as predicted
		from analysis of genomic sequences, are also listed.
