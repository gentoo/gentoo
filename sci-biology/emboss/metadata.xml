		EMBOSS is "The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite".
		EMBOSS is a free Open Source software analysis package specially
		developed for the needs of the molecular biology (e.g. EMBnet) user
		community. The software automatically copes with data in a variety
		of formats and even allows transparent retrieval of sequence data
		from the web. Also, as extensive libraries are provided with the
		package, it is a platform to allow other scientists to develop and
		release software in true open source spirit. EMBOSS also integrates
		a range of currently available packages and tools for sequence
		analysis into a seamless whole. EMBOSS breaks the historical trend
		towards commercial software packages.
