UCHIME is a new algorithm for detecting chimeric sequences. It was developed in 
collaboration with Brian Haas, Jose Carlos Clemente, Chris Quince and Rob 
Knight. Chimeras are commonly created during DNA sample amplification by 
PCR, especially in community sequencing experiments using single regions 
such as the 16S rRNA gene in bacteria or the fungal ITS region. UCHIME can 
detect chimeras using a reference database or de novo using abundance 
information on the assumption that chimeras are less abundant than their 
parents because they must have undergone fewer rounds of amplification.
