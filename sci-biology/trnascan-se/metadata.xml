		tRNAscan-SE detects ~99% of eukaryotic nuclear or prokaryotic tRNA
		genes, with a false positive rate of less than one per 15 gigabases,
		and with a search speed of about 30 kb/second. It was implemented for
		large-scale human genome sequence analysis, but is applicable to
		other DNAs as well.
