Description: Remove wxSTRING_MAXLEN (removed in wx3.0) and incomp. definition.
 The definition wxSTRING_MAXLEN was removed from the public API of wxWidgets.
 Its meaning was basically "take all the string", whenever a string length was
 expected. The missing definition didn't raise a compilation error because
 TreeLib's treedrawer.h contained a fall-back definition, which is however
 incompatible with the original definition of wxWidgets and therefore is
 interpreted by wxWidgets as a number representing the real string length.
 This patch gets rid of the dangerous fall-back definition and of all of its
 uses by using alternative wxString constructors that achieve the same
 behavior.
