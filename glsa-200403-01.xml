    <p>
    Yuuichi Teranishi discovered a flaw in libxml2 versions prior to 2.6.6.
    When the libxml2 library fetches a remote resource via FTP or HTTP, libxml2
    uses parsing routines that can overflow a buffer caused by improper bounds
    checking if they are passed a URL longer than 4096 bytes.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    If an attacker is able to exploit an application using libxml2 that parses
    remote resources, then this flaw could be used to execute arbitrary code.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    No workaround is available; users are urged to upgrade libxml2 to 2.6.6.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All users are recommended to upgrade their libxml2 installation:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    # emerge -pv "&gt;=dev-libs/libxml2-2.6.6"
    # emerge "&gt;=dev-libs/libxml2-2.6.6"</code>
  </resolution>
