		From author's description:
		Spent some time looking around the net to find a font that mimics
		DEC VT220 terminal glyph appearance. There is none. There are some
		old bitmapped fonts from X11 and probably early MacOS distributions
		that claim to be DEC fonts, they are functional but their visual quality
		is lacking and nostalgic value is absent. What I wanted was a font that
		fills my virtual terminal window with the magic hacking glow.
