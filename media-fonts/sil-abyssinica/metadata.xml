    The Ethiopic script is used for writing many of the languages of
    Ethiopia and Eritrea.  Ethiopic (U+1200..U+137F) was added to
    Unicode 3.0.  Ethiopic Supplement (U+1380..U+139F) and Ethiopic
    Extended (U+2D80..U+2DDF) were added to Unicode 4.1. Abyssinica
    SIL supports all Ethiopic characters which are in Unicode
    including the Unicode 4.1 extensions. Some languages of Ethiopia
    are not yet able to be fully represented in Unicode and, where
    necessary, we have included non-Unicode characters in the Private
    Use Area (see Private-use (PUA) characters supported by Abyssinica
    SIL).

    Abyssinica SIL is based on Ethiopic calligraphic traditions. This
    release is a regular typeface, with no bold or italic version
    available or planned.
