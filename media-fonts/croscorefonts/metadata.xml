    Arimo, Cousine and Tinos were designed by Steve Matteson as innovative,
    refreshing default on-screen font designs that are metrically compatible
    with Arial, Courier New and Times New Roman. These fonts offer improved
    on-screen readability characteristics and the pan-European WGL character
    set and solve the needs of developers looking for width-compatible fonts
    to address document portability across platforms.
    Symbol Neu is a metrically compatible font to Symbol.
