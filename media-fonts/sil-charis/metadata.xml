    Welcome to the Charis SIL font package. Charis is similar to
    Bitstream Charter, one of the first fonts designed specifically
    for laser printers. It is highly readable and holds up well in
    less-than-ideal reproduction environments. It also has a full set
    of styles - regular, italic, bold, bold italic - and so is more
    useful in general publishing than Doulos SIL. Charis is a serif,
    proportionally-spaced font optimized for readability in long
    printed documents.
