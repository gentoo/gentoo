    bdf2sfd is a BDF to SFD converter, allowing to vectorize bitmap fonts. It
    works by converting each pixel of a glyph to a polygon, which produces
    large and unoptimized SFD files that should be post-processed using
    FontForge. There are several reasons why it might be desirable to convert
    bitmap fonts to OpenType or TrueType versions. This allow for example to
    use them as Web fonts, or simply to keep using them in some terminal
    emulators, since Pango 1.44 dropped support for bitmap fonts. It was
    originally created to generate OpenType versions of Spleen, and is released
    in the hope it can be useful to convert other fonts as well.
