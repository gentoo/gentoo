    Scheherazade and Lateef are extended Arabic script fonts designed
    by SIL International for modern Unicode-based systems using either
    OpenType or AAT (Apple Advanced Typography) for complex-script
    rendering. They support virtually all of the Unicode 4.1 Arabic
    character repertoire (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms
    blocks, which are not recommended for normal use). Each typeface
    is currently available in Regular weight only.

    Scheherazade, named after the heroine of the classic Arabian
    Nights tale, is designed in a similar style to traditional
    typefaces such as Monotype Naskh, extended to cover the full
    Unicode Arabic repertoire.

    Lateef is named after Shah Abdul Lateef Bhitai, the famous Sindhi
    mystic and poet. It is intended to be an appropriate style for use
    in Sindhi and other languages of the South Asian region.
