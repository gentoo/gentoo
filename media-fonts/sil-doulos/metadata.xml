    Welcome to the Doulos SIL font package. The goal for this product
    was to provide a single Unicode-based font family that would
    contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any
    Roman- or Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for phonetic
    or orthographic needs. In addition, there is provision for other
    characters and symbols useful to linguists. This font makes use of
    state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex typographic
    issues, such as the need to position arbitrary combinations of
    base glyphs and diacritics optimally.

    Doulos is very similar to Times/Times New Roman, but only has a
    single face - regular. It is intended for use alongside other
    Times-like fonts where a range of styles (italic, bold) are not
    needed.
