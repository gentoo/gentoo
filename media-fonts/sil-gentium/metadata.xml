	Gentium is a typeface family designed to enable the diverse ethnic
	groups around the world who use the Latin, Cyrillic and Greek
	scripts to produce readable, high-quality publications. It supports
	a wide range of Latin- and Cyrillic-based alphabets.

	The design is intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact,
	and visually attractive. The additional ‘extended’ Latin letters are
	designed to naturally harmonize with the traditional 26 ones.
	Diacritics are treated with careful thought and attention to their
	use. Gentium also supports both polytonic and monotonic Greek.
	Gentium Plus now includes more extended Latin glyphs (Unicode 5.1),
	archaic Greek symbols, and full extended Cyrillic script support.
