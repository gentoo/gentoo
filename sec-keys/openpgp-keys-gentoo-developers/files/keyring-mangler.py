# Takes as input:
# 1. authority keys as gentoo-auth.asc (sec-keys/openpgp-keys-gentoo-auth);
# 2. a downloaded, unverified bundle of active developers from qa-reports.gentoo.org (https://qa-reports.gentoo.org/output/active-devs.gpg);
#    but this must be converted to ASCII first(!), and
# 3. an output file (armored).
#
# Outputs armored keyring with all expired keys dropped and all keys without
# a signature from the L2 developer key dropped.

# Usage: python keyring-mangler.py <gentoo-auth.asc> <active-devs.gpg> <output for armored keys.asc>
