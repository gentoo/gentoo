.SH DESCRIPTION
.B samplicator
is simple program listens for UDP datagrams (NetFlow, sFlow, SNMP Trap, Syslog)
on a network port, and sends copies of these datagrams on to a set of destinations.
Optionally, it can perform sampling, i.e. rather than forwarding every packet,
forward only 1 in N. Another option is that it can "spoof" the IP source address,
so that the copies appear to come from the original source, rather than the relay.
.SH OPTIONS
The following command-line options are accepted by the server:
.IP "\-p \fIport\fP"
UDP port to accept flows on. Default \- 2000.
.IP "\-s \fIaddress\fP"
interface address to accept flows on. Default \- any.
.IP "\-d \fIlevel\fP"
debug level
.IP "\-b \fIsize\fP"
set socket buffer size. Default \- 65536.
.IP \-n
don't compute UDP checksum (leave at 0)
.IP \-S
maintain (spoof) source addresses
.IP "\-x \fIdelay\fP"
transmit delay in microseconds
.IP "\-c \fIconfig\fP"
specify a config file to read
.IP \-f
fork program into background
.IP \-h
print this usage message and exit
.IP A.B.C.D
is the receiver's IP address
.IP "\fIport\fP"
is the UDP port to send to. Default \- 2000.
.IP "\fIfreq\fP"
is the sampling rate. Default \- 1.
.IP "\fIttl\fP"
is the sending packets TTL value. Default \- 64.
.SH CONFIG
A.B.C.D[/E.F.G.H]: receiver
.IP A.B.C.D
is the senders IP address
.IP E.F.G.H
is a mask to apply to the sender. Default \- 255.255.255.255.
.IP receiver
is the IP address of receiver
.SH NOTES
.B samplicator
currently only supports IPv4.
.PP
Receivers specified on the command line will get all packets, those specified in the
.IR config
will get only packets with a matching source.
