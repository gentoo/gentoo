# Additional options for asterisk
#
# see "asterisk -h" for a list of options
#
# No default.
#
#ASTERISK_OPTS=""

#
# User and group to run asterisk as
#
# Value: double-colon separated list of user and group, or empty to run as root:
#
#
# "asterisk:asterisk" to run as user "asterisk" and group "asterisk"
# "asterisk" to run as user "asterisk" and all groups that user "asterisk" is a member of
# ":asterisk" to run as user "root" and group "asterisk"
#
# Default: asterisk
#
#ASTERISK_USER="asterisk"

#
# Nicelevel
#
# Set the priority of the asterisk process
#
# Value: (highest) -20..19 (lowest)
#
# No default (leave scheduling to be system default).
#
#ASTERISK_NICE="19"

# Send crash notifications emails to this address
# (needs a working mail service and /usr/sbin/sendmail to do so (e.g. ssmtp))
#
# Value: Email address or empty to disable
#
# No default.
#
#ASTERISK_NOTIFY_EMAIL="root"

#
# Send asterisk's output to this terminal
#
# Value: Full path to device node or a number
#
# No default.
#
#ASTERISK_TTY="/dev/tty9"

#
# Start an asterisk console on the terminal specified by ASTERISK_TTY
#
# Warning! Use only for debugging, this is a potential security issue!
#
# Value: yes/no
#
# Default: no
#
#ASTERISK_CONSOLE="no"

#
# Maximum size of core files.
#
# Value: Size in bytes, unlimited for no limit or empty to disable.
#
# Default:  do not generate core dumps
#
#ASTERISK_CORE_SIZE="unlimited"

#
# ASTERISK_CORE_DIR
#
# Value: Directory (will be created if non-existant).
#
# Default: /tmp
#
#ASTERISK_CORE_DIR="/var/lib/asterisk/core"

#
# Max number of filedescriptors.  asterisk can trivially run out of
# descriptors.  In most (SIP) cases it uses at least four descriptors per call,
# and this is a conservative value.
#
# Value: Number of descriptors
#
# Default: leave system default in place.
#
ASTERISK_MAX_FD="4096"

#
# Delay time before restarting asterisk after a crash.
#
# Value: Number of seconds to sleep after a crash before restarting.
#
# Default: 5
#
#ASTERISK_RESTART_DELAY=5

#
# The stop mechanism to use.  Asterisk can do gracefully, when convenient or now.
# By default we expect you to want to stop as soon as possible, so we default
#
# Default: gracefully
#
#ASTERISK_STOP_METHOD="when convenient"

#
# By default the init script waits two minutes for asterisk to stop.  This allows
# you to change that, or even completely disable and go into wait for ever mode (-1).
# The value here is in seconds.
#
# Default: 120
#
#ASTERISK_STOP_TIMEOUT=-1

#
# ASTERISK_CONFDIR
#
# If you'd like an alternative folder to /etc/${RC_SVCNAME} to be used
# (typically /etc/asterisk) to be used for configuration.
#
# Default: /etc/${RC_SVCNAME}
#
#ASTERISK_CONFDIR="/etc/foo/bar"

# ASTERISK_CACHEDIR
#
# Value: Directory to which astcachedir in asterisk.conf is set.
#
# Default: /var/cache/asterisk
#
#ASTERISK_CACHEDIR="/var/cache/asterisk"


#
# Normally the init script will not wait for asterisk to fully boot.  With this
# setting set to yes/true/1 it will issue a "core waitfullybooted" directly
# after starting asterisk, and wait for asterisk to start up completely.  This
# is useful in certain conditions where other software requires asterisk to be
# properly started before they themselves can be started.
#
# Default:  no
#
#ASTERISK_WAITBOOTED=yes

#
# When core-dumping, the default was to generate core-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).
# In certain highly unusual configurations it's helpful to also get the
# hostname into this filename.  By enabling this option the wrapper loop will
# adjust the core file to be named core-$(hostname)-$(date ...).
#
# Default: no
#
#ASTERISK_CORE_USEHOSTNAME=yes

#
# When core-dumping, the default is to not compress these files.  However, as it turns
# out, compressing these core files can save significant amount of space, so if you
# want them compressed, specify the tool to use here.
#
# Default: do not compress
#
#ASTERISK_CORE_COMPRESS=bzip2
