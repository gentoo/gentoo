		Spiped (pronounced "ess-pipe-dee") is a utility for creating symmetrically
		encrypted and authenticated pipes between socket addresses, so that one may
		connect to one address (e.g., a UNIX socket on localhost) and transparently
		have a connection established to another address (e.g., a UNIX socket on a
		different system). This is similar to 'ssh -L' functionality, but does not
		use SSH and requires a pre-shared symmetric key.
