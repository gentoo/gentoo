.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
ucarp allows a pair of hosts to share common IP addresses in
order to provide automatic failover of an address from one machine to
another. It is a portable userland implementation of the secure and
patent-free Common Address Redundancy Protocol, (CARP), OpenBSD's
alternative to VRRP.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
ucarp supports the following command line options:
.IP "\fB-i \fIINTERFACE\fR\fP\fB \-\-interface=\fIINTERFACE\fR\fP" 10
The network interface to bind to.
.IP "\fB-s \fIIPADDRESS\fR\fP\fB \-\-srcip=\fIIPADDRESS\fR\fP" 10
The persistent source address, (real IP), associated with this
interface.
.IP "\fB-v \fIVHID\fR\fP\fB \-\-vhid=\fIVHID\fR\fP" 10
The id of the virtual server [1-255].
.IP "\fB-p \fIPASSWORD\fR\fP\fB \-\-pass=\fIPASSWORD\fR\fP" 10
The shared password, (this gets encrypted and is not sent in the
clear).
.IP "\fB-o \fIPASSFILE\fR\fP\fB \-\-passfile=\fIPASSFILE\fR\fP" 10
File to read the shared password from. The file specified
should contain the password on the first line of the file.
.IP "\fB-P \fP\fB\-\-preempt\fP" 10
Turn on preemptive failover. This causes an instance of
ucarp to assume master status right immediately.
.IP "\fB-n \fP\fB\-\-neutral\fP" 10
Do not run the downscript on startup when the
initial state is backup.
.IP "\fB-a \fIIPADDRESS\fR\fP\fB \-\-addr=\fIIPADDRESS\fR\fP" 10
The IP address of the virtual server.
.IP "\fB-h \fP\fB\-\-help\fP" 10
Display a brief summary of the command line options.
.IP "\fB-b \fISECONDS\fR\fP\fB \-\-advbase=\fISECONDS\fR\fP" 10
Interval in seconds that advertisements will occur, (defaults
to 1 second).
.IP "\fB-k \fISKEW\fR\fP\fB \-\-advskew=\fISKEW\fR\fP" 10
Advertisement skew [1-255], (defaults to 0).
.IP "\fB-u \fICOMMAND\fR\fP\fB \-\-upscript=\fICOMMAND\fR\fP" 10
Specifies the command to run after ucarp has successfully
become master, the interface name gets passed as an argument.
Typically a script used to bring up the virtual address, log the
result, add routes, clear arp cache entries, etc.
.IP "\fB-d \fICOMMAND\fR\fP\fB \-\-downscript=\fICOMMAND\fR\fP" 10
Specifies the command that is run after ucarp has
transitioned to the backup state, the interface name is passed
as an argument. This is typically a script used to bring down
the virtual interface, log the action, remove routes, etc.
.IP "\fB-r \fIRATIO\fR\fP\fB \-\-deadratio=\fIRATIO\fR\fP" 10
Ratio used by the backup to determine how long to wait for an
unresponsive master before considering it dead.
.IP "\fB-z\fP\fB \-\-shutdown\fP" 10
Use of this command causes the command specified by the \-d
argument to be invoked when ucarp shuts down.
.IP "\fB-B\fP\fB \-\-daemonize\fP" 10
Causes ucarp to detach from the terminal and run in the
background as a daemon.
.IP "\fB-f\fP\fB \-\-facility\fP" 10
Set the syslog facility, defaults to daemon.
.IP "\fB-x \fIPARAMETER\fR\fP\fB \-\-xparam=\fIPARAMETER\fR\fP" 10
Specify an extra parameter to be supplied to the up/down
scripts.
.IP "\fB-S\fP\fB \-\-ignoreifstate\fP" 10
Ignore unplugged network cables. This option is useful when
ucarp nodes are connected with a crossover cable. Without
this option the master will transition to backup when the other
node is powered down, as it no longer has a link (NO-CARRIER).

.IP "\fB-M\fP\fB \-\-nomcast\fP" 10
Use broadcast instead of multicast advertisements.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
A host with a real IP of 10.1.1.10 configured to be the master
in a preemptive configuration with a virtual IP of 10.1.1.252.
.PP
.nf
\fB    \fPucarp \-i eth0 \-s 10.1.1.10 \-v 10 \-p secret \-a 10.1.1.252 \\
\fB    \fP\-\-upscript=/etc/vip-up.sh \-\-downscript=/etc/vip-down.sh \-P
.fi
.PP
The backup might be configured something like this.
.PP
.nf
\fB    \fPucarp \-i eth0 \-s 10.1.1.11 \-v 10 \-p secret \-a 10.1.1.252 \\
\fB    \fP\-\-upscript=/etc/vip-up.sh \-\-downscript=/etc/vip-down.sh
.fi
.PP
A machine with a real IP of 192.168.1.19 is the preferred master for
a virtual IP of 10.1.12.7, broadcasts are sent every 5 seconds.
.PP
.nf
\fB    \fPucarp \-b 5 \-s 192.168.1.19 \-v 27 \-p badpass \-a 10.1.12.7 \\
\fB    \fP-u /etc/vip-up.sh \-d /etc/vip-down.sh \-z
.fi
.PP
The hot standby with an IP of 192.168.1.20 uses the following
command, (note the advskew of 50 putting it at a disadvantage and making
the first machine preferred).
.PP
.nf
\fB    \fPucarp \-b 5 \-k 50 \-s 192.168.1.20 \-v 27 \-p badpass \-a 10.1.12.7 \\
\fB    \fP-u /etc/vip-up.sh \-d /etc/vip-down.sh \-z
.fi
.SH "SIGNALS"
.PP
Sending the ucarp process a SIGUSR1 will have it log a status
line to syslog, eg "Sep 13 12:59:56 localhost ucarp[2654]: [INFO]
MASTER on eth0 id 1" or "Sep 13 13:00:25 localhost ucarp[2644]: [INFO]
BACKUP on eth0 id 1"
.PP
Sending the ucarp process a SIGUSR2 will cause it to demote itself
from master to backup, pause 3 seconds, then proceed as usual to listen
for other masters, and promote itself if necessary. This could be useful
if you wish another node to take over master.
