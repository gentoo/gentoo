# /etc/conf.d/minissdpd: config file for /etc/init.d/minissdpd

# Configure on which interface or interfaces minissdpd will listen.
# List all interfaces space separated. If this is not specified then
# minissdpd will listen on just the interface for the default route.
# You probably want that when running minissdpd with miniupnpc on the
# client, but you most likely want to specify the internal interface
# when running with miniupnpd on the gateway.
