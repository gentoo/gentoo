Subject: [PATCH] config/iperf_config_static_bin.m4: fix bashism

configure scripts need to be runnable with a POSIX-compliant /bin/sh.

On many (but not all!) systems, /bin/sh is provided by Bash, so errors
like this aren't spotted. Notably Debian defaults to /bin/sh provided
by dash which doesn't tolerate such bashisms as '=='.

This retains compatibility with bash.

Fixes configure warnings/errors like:
```
./configure: 2670: test: x: unexpected operator
```
