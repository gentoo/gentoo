		SX Cluster is a reliable, fully distributed cluster solution for your data storage needs, released under the GPL licence. With SX Cluster you aggregate the disk space available on multiple servers and merge it into a single storage system. The cluster makes sure that your data is always replicated over multiple nodes (the exact number of copies is defined by the sysadmin) and synchronized. Additionally Sx has built-in support for deduplication, client-side encryption, on-the-fly compression and much more.
