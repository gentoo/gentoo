	<longdescription>Sitemap Gen is a python script which will generate an xml Sitemap for
		your web site.
		The sitemap_gen.py script analyzes your web server and generates one or
		more Sitemap files. These files are XML listings of content you make
		available on your web server. The files can be directly submitted to
		search engines as hints for the search engine web crawlers as they
		index your web site. This can result in better coverage of your web
		content in search engine indices, and less of your bandwidth spent
		doing it.
		The sitemap_gen.py script is written in Python 2.2 and released to the
		open source community for continuous improvements.</longdescription>
