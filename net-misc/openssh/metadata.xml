		OpenSSH is a FREE version of the SSH protocol suite of network connectivity tools that
		increasing numbers of people on the Internet are coming to rely on. Many users of telnet,
		rlogin, ftp, and other such programs might not realize that their password is transmitted
		across the Internet unencrypted, but it is. OpenSSH encrypts all traffic (including passwords)
		to effectively eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other network-level attacks.
		Additionally, OpenSSH provides a myriad of secure tunneling capabilities, as well as a variety
		of authentication methods.

		The OpenSSH suite includes the ssh program which replaces rlogin and telnet, scp which
		replaces rcp, and sftp which replaces ftp. Also included is sshd which is the server side of
		the package, and the other basic utilities like ssh-add, ssh-agent, ssh-keysign, ssh-keyscan,
		ssh-keygen and sftp-server. OpenSSH supports SSH protocol versions 1.3, 1.5, and 2.0.
