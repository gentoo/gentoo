		Jigsaw Download, or jigdo for short, is a tool designed to ease the
		distribution of very large files over the internet, for example CD or
		DVD images. Its aim is to make downloading the images as easy for users
		as a click on a direct download link in a browser, while avoiding all
		the problems that server administrators have with hosting such large
		files.
