UDPcast is a file transfer tool that can send data simultaneously to 
many destinations on a LAN. This can for instance be used to install 
entire classrooms of PC's at once. The advantage of UDPcast over using 
other methods (nfs, ftp, whatever) is that UDPcast uses Ethernet's 
multicast abilities: it won't take longer to install 15 machines than it 
would to install just 2.
