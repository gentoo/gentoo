		IGMP/MLD proxies offer the possibility option to combine
		local multicast networks with a larger multicast infrastructure.
		In contrast to multicast routers, proxies are lightweight and
		do not require the support of a multicast routing protocol such as PIM or DVMRP.
		A common use case is a local stub networks that interconnects with
		a remote multicast routing domain, e.g. via a tunnel.
		But it can also be used in PMIPv6 domain to enable multicast for sources and listeners (RFC 6224).
		The Mcproxy meets the requirements of the IGMP/MLD proxying standard (RFC 4605)
		and has additional functionalities. The multicast proxy can be instantiated multiple times,
		is dynamically configurable at runtime, supports multiple upstreams and peering-interfaces
		for a non hierarchical interconnection of multicast proxies.
