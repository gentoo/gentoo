shmux is program for executing the same command on many hosts in parallel.
For each target, a child process is spawned by shmux, and a shell on the
target obtained one of the supported methods: rsh, ssh, or sh. The output
produced by the children is received by shmux and either (optionally)
output in turn to the user, and/or written to files for later processing.
The list of targets may either be specified on the command line or be read
from the standard input.
