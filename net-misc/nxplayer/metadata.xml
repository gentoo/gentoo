	<longdescription>Enterprise Client is a free easy-to-use connection interface to allow quick access to your remote host where you have installed one of the NoMachine products. It's available for those who prefer just a standalone client application, rather than the NoMachine server/client app, either because regulatory requirements dictate that thin clients must install \“client-side\” software only, or simply because a scaled-down client app is your personal preference.</longdescription>
