PyHoca-GUI is a client implementation for X2Go using the project's Python X2Go client API (a Python module). PyHoca-GUI uses wxPython for rendering graphical desktop elements (menus, dialog boxes etc.).

PyHoca-GUI is designed as a very minimal GUI that behaves very similar to GNOME's network manager applet (nm-applet). It appears as a small Phoca icon (a little seal) that docks to your systray panel (also called notification area) and allows you to manage multiple X2go sessions simultaneously.
