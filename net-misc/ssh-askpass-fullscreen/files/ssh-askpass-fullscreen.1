.SH NAME
ssh-askpass-fullscreen \- A simple replacement for ssh-askpass written with gtk2
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ssh-askpass-fullscreen

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP

.B gnome-ssh-askpass
is a GNOME-based passphrase dialog for use with OpenSSH. It is
intended to be called by the
.B ssh-add(1)
program and not invoked directly.  It allows 
.B ssh-add(1)
to obtain a passphrase from a user, even if not connected to a terminal
(assuming that an X display is available).  This happens auto-matically
in the case where
.B ssh-add 
is invoked from one's 
.B ~/.xsession or as one of the GNOME startup programs, for example.

In order to be called automatically by 
.B ssh-add, 
.B ssh-askpass-fullscreen
should be installed as /usr/bin/ssh-askpass
