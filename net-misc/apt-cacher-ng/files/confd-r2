# Specify the network services that correspond to the "BindAddress"
# setting in your apt-cacher-ng.conf. For example, if you bind to
# 127.0.0.1, then this should be set to "net.lo" which provides the
# loopback interface. The default BindAddress listens on all available
# interfaces, for which it suffices to have only one (net.lo) up.
