		ethflop is a DOS TSR that emulates a floppy disk drive.
		The emulated (virtual) floppy disk is, in fact, stored on a Linux server as a floppy image.
		All the communication between ethflop (the TSR) and ethflopd (the Linux daemon) is exchanged over raw Ethernet.
		No need for any network configuration - the DOS PC only needs to have some kind of Ethernet adapter
		(physical or emulated, for example through PLIP) and a suitable packet driver.
		The Linux server and the DOS PC must be connected to a common Ethernet segment (same LAN).
