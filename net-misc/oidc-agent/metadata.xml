		oidc-agent is a set of tools to manage OpenID Connect tokens and make them
		easily usable from the command line. We followed the ssh-agent design, so users
		can handle OIDC tokens in a similar way as they do with ssh keys.
		oidc-agent is usually started in the beginning of an X-session or a login
		session. Through use of environment variables the agent can be located and
		used to handle OIDC tokens.
