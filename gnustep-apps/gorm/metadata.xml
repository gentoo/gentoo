Before NeXT Computer Inc. revolutionized software developement with its OpenStep API, a new way of designing graphical user interfaces was already introduced by NeXT at the beginning of the 90s. Its operating system NeXTstep featured Interface Builder, an application that for the first time allowed developers to quickly create nice user interfaces without having to code everything manually. Using drag and drop elements of windows such as buttons, sliders, textfields etc were created abd edited, then linked to functions and variables. Thus, Interface Builder helped developers to focus on the code for the actual functions without having to care about stuff not related to their project goal.

As part of the GNUstep project, Gorm is meant to be the counter part to NeXT's Interface Builder. With Gorm designing tough and complex graphical interfaces for your applications can easy and quickly be done using drag and drop, powerful inspectors and teamwork with ProjectCenter.

Gorm allows developers to quickly create and edit graphical application interfaces using a whole lot of GUI elements: windows, menus, buttons, labels, sliders, tables, textfields, browsers, images, altert panels and more. Custom palettes can be dynamically loaded to add additional elements or functionality.
