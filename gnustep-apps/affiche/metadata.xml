<longdescription>
Affiche is a little application that allows people to "stick" little notes on their computer desktop. It works well under GNUstep and under Apple Mac OS X.

The goal of this little application is to provide a good example on how to develop cross-platform applications between GNUstep and Apple Mac OS X while providing a useful application at the same time.
