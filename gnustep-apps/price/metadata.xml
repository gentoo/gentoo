PRICE, which stands for Precision Raster Image Convolution Engine, aims to be a high quality Image filtering, enhancing and manipulation program. It is written in Objective-C and AppKit, so being designed for Cocoa and GNUstep, it should be portable to OpenSTEP (I hope so, currently I don't have the computers to do the porting).
