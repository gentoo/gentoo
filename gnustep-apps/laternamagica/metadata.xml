	<longdescription>LaternaMagica is a single-window image viewer application which is capable of switching to full-screen mode.
LaternaMagica maintains its image list in a window and the user selects which image to display, making it easy to assemble a show from different source directories.
LaternaMagica can recurse into directories when looking for images to add and construct the list.
LaternaMagica is capable of exporting the complete list to a folder by operating resizing and file conversion</longdescription>
