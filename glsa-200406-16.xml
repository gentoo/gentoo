    The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
    open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems. The goal of this
    project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that
    provides services in tune with the current HTTP standards.

  <description>
    <p>
    A bug in the proxy_util.c file may lead to a remote buffer overflow. To
    trigger the vulnerability an attacker would have to get mod_proxy to
    connect to a malicous server which returns an invalid (negative)
    Content-Length.
    </p>

  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    An attacker could cause a Denial of Service as the Apache child handling
    the request, which will die and under some circumstances execute arbitrary
    code as the user running Apache, usually "apache".
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>

    upgrade to the latest available version:
