	<longdescription>
		Klein is a micro-framework for developing production-ready web services
		with Python. It is 'micro' in that it has an incredibly small API
		similar to Bottle and Flask. It is not 'micro' in that it depends on
		things outside the standard library. This is primarily because it is
		built on widely used and well tested components like Werkzeug and
		Twisted.
