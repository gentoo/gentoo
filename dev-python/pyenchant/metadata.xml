  <longdescription lang="en">PyEnchant is a set of language bindings and some wrapper classes to
		make the excellent Enchant spellchecker available as a Python
		module. The bindings are generated using SWIG. It includes all the
		functionality of Enchant with the flexibility of Python and a nice
		'Pythonic' object-oriented interface. It also aims to provide some
		higher-level functionality than is available in the C API.</longdescription>
