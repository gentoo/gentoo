		This module implements a very fast JSON encoder/decoder for Python.

		JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a text based
		lightweight data exchange format which is easy for humans to
		read/write and for machines to parse/generate. JSON is completely
		language independent and has multiple implementations in most of
		the programming languages, making it ideal for data exchange and
		storage.

		The module is written in C and it is up to 250 times faster when
		compared to the other python JSON implementations which are written
		directly in python. This speed gain varies with the complexity of
		the data and the operation and is the the range of 10-200 times for
		encoding operations and in the range of 100-250 times for decoding
		operations.
