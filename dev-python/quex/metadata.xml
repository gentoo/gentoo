		It is:
		a tool to generate lexical analyzers. A lexical analyzer is a program
		that transforms a stream of characters into a stream of
		'atomic chunks of meaning', so called tokens.
		
		It does:
		generate directly coded lexical analyzers, rather than table based
		engines.
		respond to queries on Unicode properties and regular expressions on the
		command line.
		generate state transition graphs of the generated engines.
