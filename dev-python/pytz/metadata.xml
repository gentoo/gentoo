  pytz brings the Olson tz database into Python. This library allows
  accurate and cross platform timezone calculations using Python 2.3
  or higher. It also solves the issue of ambiguous times at the end of
  daylight savings, which you can read more about in the Python
  Library Reference (datetime.tzinfo).
  Amost all (over 540) of the Olson timezones are supported.
