     ASDF (Advanced Scientific Data Format) is a proposed
     next generation interchange format for scientific data. ASDF aims to
     exist in the same middle ground that made FITS so successful, by
     being a hybrid text and binary format: containing human editable
     metadata for interchange, and raw binary data that is fast to load
     and use. Unlike FITS, the metadata is highly structured and is
     designed up-front for extensibility.
