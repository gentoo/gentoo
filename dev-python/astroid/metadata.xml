  <longdescription lang="en">The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of
  python source code for projects such as pychecker, pyreverse,
  pylint... Well, actually the development of this library is
  essentially governed by pylint's needs.
  It provides a compatible representation which comes from the _ast
  module. It rebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module by
  recursively walking down the AST and building an extended ast (let's
  call it astng ;). The new node classes have additional methods and
  attributes for different usages. They include some support for static
  inference and local name scopes. Furthermore, astng builds partial
  trees by inspecting living objects.</longdescription>
