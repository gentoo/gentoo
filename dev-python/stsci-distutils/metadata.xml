  This package contains utilities used to package some of STScI's Python
  projects; specifically those projects that comprise stsci_python and
  Astrolib.
  It currently consists mostly of some setup_hook scripts meant for use with
  distutils2/packaging and/or d2to1, and a customized easy_install command
  meant for use with distribute.
