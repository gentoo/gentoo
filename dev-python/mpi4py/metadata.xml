  <longdescription lang="en">MPI for Python (mpi4py) provides bindings of the Message Passing
  Interface (MPI) standard for the Python programming language,
  allowing any Python program to exploit multiple processors.
  This package is constructed on top of the MPI-1/MPI-2 specification
  and provides an object oriented interface which closely follows
  MPI-2 C++ bindings. It supports point-to-point (sends, receives) and
  collective (broadcasts, scatters, gathers) communications of any
  picklable Python object as well as optimized communications of
  Python object exposing the single-segment buffer interface (NumPy
  arrays, builtin bytes/string/array objects).
