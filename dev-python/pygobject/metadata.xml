    GObject is a object system used by GTK+, GStreamer and other libraries.
    PyGObject provides a convenient wrapper for use in Python programs when
    accessing GObject libraries. Like the GObject library itself PyGObject
    is licensed under the GNU LGPL, so is suitable for use in both free
    software and proprietary applications. It is already in use in many
    applications ranging from small single purpose scripts up to large full
    featured applications. PyGObject now dynamically accesses any GObject
    libraries that uses GObject Introspection. It replaces the need for
    separate modules such as PyGTK, GIO and python-gnome to build a full
    GNOME 3.0 application. Once new functionality is added to gobject
    library it is instantly available as a Python API without the need for
    intermediate Python glue.
