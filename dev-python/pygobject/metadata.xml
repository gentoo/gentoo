		GObject is a object system used by GTK+, GStreamer and other libraries.
		PyGObject provides a convenient wrapper for use in Python programs when
		accessing GObject libraries. Like the GObject library itself PyGObject
		is licensed under the GNU LGPL, so is suitable for use in both free
		software and proprietary applications. It is already in use in many
		applications ranging from small single purpose scripts up to large full
		featured applications. PyGObject now dynamically accesses any GObject
		libraries that uses GObject Introspection. It replaces the need for
		separate modules such as PyGTK, GIO and python-gnome to build a full
		GNOME 3.0 application. Once new functionality is added to gobject
		library it is instantly available as a Python API without the need for
		intermediate Python glue.
