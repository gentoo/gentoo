  The pyface project contains a toolkit-independent GUI abstraction
  layer, which is used to support the "visualization" features of the
  Traits package. Thus, you can write code in terms of the Traits API
  (views, items, editors, etc.), and let pyface and your selected
  toolkit and back-end take care of the details of displaying them.
  The following GUI backends are supported:
    * wxPython
    * PyQt
    * PySide
