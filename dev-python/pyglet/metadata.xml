  <longdescription lang="en">This library provides an object-oriented programming interface
  for developing games and other visually-rich applications with Python.
  pyglet has virtually no external dependencies. For most applications
  and game requirements, pyglet needs nothing else besides Python,
  simplifying distribution and installation. It also handles
  multiple windows and fully aware of multi-monitor setups.
  pyglet might be seen as an alternative to PyGame.</longdescription>
