		Python Bindings for IPtables: Iptables is the tool that is used to manage netfilter,
		the standard packet filtering and manipulation framework under Linux. As the iptables
		manpage puts it: Iptables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv4
		packet filter rules in the Linux kernel. Several different tables may be defined.
		Each table contains a number of built-in chains and may also contain user-defined
		chains. Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets. Each rule
		specifies what to do with a packet that matches. This is called a target, which may be
		a jump to a user-defined chain in the same table. Python-iptables provides python
		bindings to iptables under Linux. Interoperability with iptables is achieved via
		using the iptables C libraries (libiptc, libxtables, and the iptables extensions), not
		calling the iptables binary and parsing its output.
