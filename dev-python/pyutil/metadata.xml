		pyutil -- a library of useful Python functions and classes
		==========================================================

		Many of these utilities (or their ancestors) were developed for
		the Mojo
		Nation, Mnet, Allmydata.com "Mountain View", Tahoe-LAFS, or
		SimpleGeo's
		products.  (In the case where the code was developed for a
		for-profit
		company, the copyright holder donated the pyutil code to the
		public under
		these open source licences.)
