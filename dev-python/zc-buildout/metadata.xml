	<longdescription lang="en">Buildout is a system for managing development buildouts. While often identified as a Zope project,
and indeed licensed under the ZPL by Zope creator Jim Fulton, buildout is useful for configurations
beyond Zope, and even, in rare cases, a few that have nothing to do with Python.
The Buildout project provides support for creating applications, especially Python applications. It
provides tools for assembling applications from multiple parts, Python or otherwise. An application
may actually contain multiple programs, processes, and configuration settings.
The word .buildout. refers to a description of a set of parts and the software to create and assemble
them. It is often used informally to refer to an installed system based on a buildout definition. For
example, if we are creating an application named .Foo., then .the Foo buildout. is the collection of
configuration and application-specific software that allows an instance of the application to be
created. We may refer to such an instance of the application informally as .a Foo buildout..</longdescription>
