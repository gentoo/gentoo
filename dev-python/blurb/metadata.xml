		blurb is a tool designed to rid CPython core development of the scourge of
		Misc/NEWS conflicts.

		The core concept: split Misc/NEWS into many separate files that, when
		concatenated back together in sorted order, reconstitute the original
		Misc/NEWS file. After that, Misc/NEWS could be deleted from the CPython
		repo and thereafter rendered on demand (e.g. when building a release).
		When checking in a change to CPython, the checkin process will write
		out a new file that sorts into the correct place, using a filename
		unlikely to have a merge conflict.
