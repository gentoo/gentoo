  <longdescription>
    bcolz provides columnar and compressed data containers. Column
    storage allows for efficiently querying tables with a large number of
    columns. It also allows for cheap addition and removal of column. In
    addition, bcolz objects are compressed by default for reducing
    memory/disk I/O needs. The compression process is carried out
    internally by Blosc, a high-performance compressor that is optimized
    for binary data.
