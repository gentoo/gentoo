  The OpenOpt suite of Python packages contains the following modules:
  * openopt: universal numerical optimization package with
    several solvers (e.g. ralg) and connections to tens of other,
    graphical output of convergence. 
  * FuncDesigner: tool to rapidly build functions over
    variables/arrays and get their dense/sparse derivatives via
    automatic differentiation, integration (with specifiable accuracy by
    interalg), interpolation, uncertainty analysis and interval
    analysis, eigenvalue analysis, solve systems of linear/nonlinear/ODE
    equations and numerical optimization problems coded in FuncDesigner
    by OpenOpt. 
  * DerApproximator: tool to get (or check user-supplied) derivatives
    via finite-difference approximation 
  * SpaceFuncs: tool for 2D, 3D, N-dimensional geometric modeling with
    possibilities of parametrized calculations, numerical optimization
    and solving systems of geometrical equations.
