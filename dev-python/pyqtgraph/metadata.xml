		PyQtGraph is a pure-python graphics and GUI library built on PyQt and numpy.
		It is intended for use in mathematics / scientific / engineering applications.
		Despite being written entirely in python, the library is very fast
		due to its heavy leverage of numpy for number crunching
		and Qt's GraphicsView framework for fast display.
