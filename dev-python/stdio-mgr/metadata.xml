Have a CLI Python application?

Want to automate testing of the actual console input &amp; output of your user-facing components?

stdio Manager can help.

While some functionality here is more or less duplicative of redirect_stdout and redirect_stderr in contextlib within the standard library, it provides (i) a much more concise way to mock both stdout and stderr at the same time, and (ii) a mechanism for mocking stdin, which is not available in contextlib.
