    This is a package to reproject astronomical images using various techniques
    via a uniform interface. Reprojection means the re-gridding of images from
    one world coordinate system to another (for example changing the pixel
    resolution, orientation, coordinate system). Currently implemented are
    reprojection of celestial images by interpolation, as well as by finding the
    exact overlap between pixels on the celestial sphere. It can also reproject
    to/from HEALPIX projections.
