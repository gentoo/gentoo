    <longdescription>
        Every game needs a user interface that matches its look and feel. The purpose of glooey is to help you make
        such an interface. Towards this end, glooey provides 7 powerful placement widgets, a label widget, an image
        widget, 3 different button widgets, a text entry widget, a variety of scroll boxes and bars, 4 different dialog
        box widgets, and a variety of other miscellaneous widgets. The appearance of any widget can be trivially
        customized, and glooey comes with built-in fantasy, puzzle, and 8-bit themes to prove it (and to help you hit
        the ground running if your game fits one of those genres).
