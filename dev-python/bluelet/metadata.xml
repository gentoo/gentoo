Bluelet is a simple, pure-Python solution for writing intelligible asynchronous socket applications. It uses PEP 342 coroutines to make concurrent I/O look and act like sequential programming.

In this way, it is similar to the Greenlet green-threads library and its associated packages Eventlet and Gevent. Bluelet has a simpler, 100% Python implementation that comes at the cost of flexibility and performance when compared to Greenlet-based solutions. However, it should be sufficient for many applications that don't need serious scalability; it can be thought of as a less-horrible alternative to asyncore or an asynchronous replacement for SocketServer (and more).
