Pyocr is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool wrapper for python. That is, it helps using OCR tools from a Python program.

It has been tested only on GNU/Linux systems. It should also work on similar systems (*BSD, etc). It doesn't work on Windows, MacOSX, etc.

Pyocr can be used as a wrapper for google's Tesseract-OCR or Cuneiform. It can read all image types supported by Pillow, including jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, and others. It also support bounding box data.
