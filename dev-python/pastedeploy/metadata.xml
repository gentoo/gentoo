	<longdescription lang="en">Paste Deployment is a system for finding and configuring WSGI applications
	and servers. For WSGI application consumers it provides a single, simple
	function (loadapp) for loading a WSGI application from a configuration file
	or a Python Egg. For WSGI application providers it only asks for a single,
	simple entry point to your application, so that application users don't need
	to be exposed to the implementation details of your application.</longdescription>
