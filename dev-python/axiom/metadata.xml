	<longdescription lang="en">Axiom is an object database, or alternatively, an object-relational
		mapper. Its primary goal is to provide an object-oriented layer with
		what we consider to be the key aspects of OO, i.e. polymorphism and
		message dispatch, without hindering the power of an RDBMS. It is
		designed to "feel pythonic", without encouraging the typical ORM
		behavior such as potato programming.</longdescription>
