	<longdescription lang="en">Axiom is an object database, or alternatively, an object-relational
		mapper. Its primary goal is to provide an object-oriented layer with
		what we consider to be the key aspects of OO, i.e. polymorphism and
		message dispatch, without hindering the power of an RDBMS. It is
		designed to &quot;feel pythonic&quot;, without encouraging the typical ORM
		behavior such as potato programming.</longdescription>
