ClientCookie is a Python module for handling HTTP cookies on the client
side, useful for accessing web sites that require cookies to be set and
then returned later. It also provides some other (optional) useful stuff:
HTTP-EQUIV and Refresh handling, automatic adding of the Referer [sic]
header, automatic observance of robots.txt and lazily-seek()able responses.
These extras are implemented using an extension that makes it easier to add
new functionality to urllib2. It has developed from a port of Gisle Aas'
Perl module HTTP::Cookies, from the libwww-perl library.
