	<longdescription lang="en">
ZConfig is a configuration library intended for general use. It supports a hierarchical schema-driven configuration model that allows a schema to specify data conversion routines written in Python. ZConfig’s model is very different from the model supported by the ConfigParser module found in Python’s standard library, and is more suitable to configuration-intensive applications.

ZConfig schema are written in an XML-based language and are able to “import” schema components provided by Python packages. Since components are able to bind to conversion functions provided by Python code in the package (or elsewhere), configuration objects can be arbitrarily complex, with values that have been verified against arbitrary constraints. This makes it easy for applications to separate configuration support from configuration loading even with configuration data being defined and consumed by a wide range of separate packages.
