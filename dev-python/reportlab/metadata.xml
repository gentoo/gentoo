    ReportLab is the time-proven, ultra-robust open-source engine for creating
    complex, data-driven PDF documents and custom vector graphics. It's free,
    open-source, and written in Python. The package sees 50,000+ downloads per
    month, is part of standard Linux distributions, is embedded in many
    products, and was selected to power the print/export feature for Wikipedia.

    The ReportLab Toolkit has evolved over the years in direct response to the
    real-world reporting needs of large institutions. The library implements
    three main layers:

        A graphics canvas API that 'draws' PDF pages A charts and widgets
        library for creating reusable data graphics. A page layout engine -
        PLATYPUS ("Page Layout and TYPography Using Scripts") - which builds
        documents from elements such as headlines, paragraphs, fonts, tables
        and vector graphics.

    The open-source ReportLab Toolkit provides the core of our commercial
    product, ReportLab PLUS, which generates PDF at higher speed and allows use
    of our smart XML-based templating language RML. ReportLab PLUS contains
    significant upgrades over the open-source library that allows for a much
    faster development cycle. If you are putting substantial time into
    building a solution please consider the commercial version; it is faster,
    does more, and the revenues directly support ongoing development. You
    can trial ReportLab PLUS for free.
