# stomp.py test suite requires quite a few appropriately configured
# messaging servers (as of 7.0.0: RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, ActiveMQ Artemis,
# stompserver). Upstream relies on Docker to provide those servers, however
# doing the same in src_test would require both granting the portage user
# extra permissions and packaging the base image (trying to download it
# on the fly would violate the network sandbox).
# Side note: PyPI tarballs do not include tests.
