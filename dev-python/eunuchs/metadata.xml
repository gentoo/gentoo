		Eunuchs is a library of Python extensions that complement the
		standard libraries in parts where full support for the UNIX API (or
		the Linux API) is missing.

		Most of the functions wrapped by Eunuchs are low-level, dirty, but
		absolutely necessary functions for real systems programming. The aim
		is to have the functions added to mainstream Python libraries.
