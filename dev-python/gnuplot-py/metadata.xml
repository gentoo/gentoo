  Gnuplot.py is a Python module that interfaces to gnuplot, the popular
  plotting program. It allows you to use gnuplot from within Python to
  plot arrays of data from memory, data files, or mathematical
  functions. If you use Python to perform computations or as `glue' for
  numerical programs, you can use this module to plot data on the fly as
  they are computed. And the combination with Python makes it is easy to
  automate things, including to create crude `animations' by plotting
  different datasets one after another.
