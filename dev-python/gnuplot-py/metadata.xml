		Gnuplot.py is a Python module that interfaces to gnuplot, the popular
		plotting program. It allows you to use gnuplot from within Python to
		plot arrays of data from memory, data files, or mathematical
		functions. If you use Python to perform computations or as `glue' for
		numerical programs, you can use this module to plot data on the fly as
		they are computed. And the combination with Python makes it is easy to
		automate things, including to create crude `animations' by plotting
		different datasets one after another.
