Wildcard Match provides an enhanced fnmatch, glob, and pathlib library in order to provide 
file matching and globbing that more closely follows the features found in Bash. In some 
ways these libraries are similar to Python's builtin libraries as they provide a similar 
interface to match, filter, and glob the file system. But they also include a number of 
features found in Bash's globbing such as backslash escaping, brace expansion, extended 
glob pattern groups, etc. They also add a number of new useful functions as well, such as 
globmatch which functions like fnmatch, but for paths.
Wildcard Match also adds a file search utility called wcmatch that is built on top of fnmatch and globmatch. It was 
originally written for Rummage, but split out into this project to be used by other 
projects that may find its approach useful.
Bash is used as a guide when making decisions on behavior for fnmatch and glob. Behavior may differ from Bash version to Bash version, 
but an attempt is made to keep Wildcard Match up with the latest relevant changes. With 
all of this said, there may be a few corner cases in which we've intentionally chosen to 
not exactly mirror Bash. If an issue is found where Wildcard Match seems to deviate in an 
illogical way, we'd love to hear about it in the issue tracker.
Features
A quick overview of Wildcard Match's
Features:
		Provides an interface comparable to Python's builtin in fnamtch, glob, and pathlib. 
		Allows for a much more configurable experience when matching or globbing with many more features. Adds support for ** in glob.
		Adds support for escaping characters with \.
		Add support for POSIX style character classes inside sequences: [[:alnum:]], etc. The C locale is used for byte strings and Unicode properties for Unicode strings.
		Adds support for brace expansion: a{b,{c,d}} --&gt; ab ac ad.
		Adds support for expanding ~ or ~username to the appropriate user path.
		Adds support for extended match patterns: @(...), +(...), *(...), ?(...), and !(...).
		Adds ability to match path names via the path centric globmatch.
		Provides a pathlib variant that uses Wildcard Match's glob library instead of Python's default.
		Provides an alternative file crawler called wcmatch.
		And more...
