		PyCXX is a set of C++ facilities to make it easier to write Python
		extensions.  The chief way in which PyCXX makes it easier to write
		Python extensions is that it increases the probability that
		your program will not make a reference-counting error and will not
		have to continually check error returns from the Python C API.
