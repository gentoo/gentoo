  FLANN is a library for performing fast approximate nearest neighbor
  searches in high dimensional spaces. It contains a collection of
  algorithms we found to work best for nearest neighbor search and a
  system for automatically choosing the best algorithm and optimum
  parameters depending on the dataset.
  This is the python binding package split from the main package.
