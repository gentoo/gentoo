	<longdescription lang="en">This library provides Python functions for agglomerative
  clustering. Its features include
  * generating hierarchical clusters from distance matrices
  * computing distance matrices from observation vectors
  * computing statistics on clusters
  * cutting linkages to generate flat clusters
  * and visualizing clusters with dendrograms. 
  The interface is very similar to MATLAB's Statistics Toolbox API to
  make code easier to port from MATLAB to Python/Numpy. The core
  implementation of this library is in C for efficiency.</longdescription>
