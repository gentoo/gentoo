<longdescription>
  Joblib is a set of tools to provide lightweight pipelining in
  Python. In particular, joblib offers:
  * transparent disk-caching of the output values and lazy
    re-evaluation (memoize pattern)
  * easy simple parallel computing
  * logging and tracing of the execution
  Joblib is optimized to be fast and robust in particular on large,
  long-running functions and has specific optimizations for numpy arrays.
