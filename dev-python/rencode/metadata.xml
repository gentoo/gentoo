	The rencode module is similar to bencode from the BitTorrent project. For
	complex, heterogeneous data structures with many small elements, r-encodings
	take up significantly less space than b-encodings. This version of rencode is
	a complete rewrite in Cython to attempt to increase the performance over the
	pure Python module written by Petru Paler, Connelly Barnes et al.
