  The CodeTools project from the Enthought Tool Suite 
  includes packages that simplify meta-programming
  and help the programmer separate data from code in Python. This
  library contains classes that allow defining simple snippets, or
  "blocks", of Python code, analyze variable dependencies in the code
  block, and use these dependencies to construct or restrict an
  execution graph. These (restricted) code blocks can then be executed
  in any namespace. However, this project also provides a
  Traits-event-enhanced namespace, called a "context", which can be used
  in place of a vanilla namespace to allow actions to be performed
  whenever variables are assigned or retrieved from the namespace. This
  project is used as the foundation for the BlockCanvas project.
