  <longdescription>
    distro (for: Linux Distribution) provides information about the
    Linux distribution it runs on, such as a reliable machine-readable
    ID, or version information. It is a renewed alternative
    implementation for Python's original platform.linux_distribution
    function, but it also provides much more functionality which isn't
    necessarily Python bound like a command-line interface.
