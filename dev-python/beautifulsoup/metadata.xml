		Beautiful Soup is a Python HTML/XML parser designed for quick
		turnaround projects like screen-scraping. Two features make it
		powerful: it won't choke if you give it bad markup and it provides a
		few simple methods and Pythonic idioms for navigating and searching
		a parse tree: a toolkit for dissecting a document and extracting
		what you need.
