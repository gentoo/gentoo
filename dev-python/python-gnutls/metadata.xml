		This package provides a high level object oriented wrapper around
		libgnutls, as well as low level bindings to the GNUTLS types and
		functions via ctypes. The high level wrapper hides the details of
		accessing the GNUTLS library via ctypes behind a set of classes that
		encapsulate GNUTLS sessions, certificates and credentials and expose
		them to python applications using a simple API.

		The package also includes a Twisted interface that has seamless
		intergration with Twisted, providing connectTLS and listenTLS methods
		on the Twisted reactor once imported (the methods are automatically
		attached to the reactor by simply importing the GNUTLS Twisted
		interface module).

		The high level wrapper is written using the GNUTLS library bindings
		that are made available via ctypes. This makes the wrapper very
		powerful and flexible as it has direct access to all the GNUTLS
		internals and is also very easy to extend without any need to write
		C code or recompile anything.
