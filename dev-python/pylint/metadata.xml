    Pylint is a Python source code analyzer which looks for programming errors,
    helps enforcing a coding standard and sniffs for some code smells (as
    defined in Martin Fowler's Refactoring book). Pylint can be seen as
    another PyChecker since nearly all tests you can do with PyChecker can also
    be done with Pylint. However, Pylint offers some more features, like
    checking length of lines of code, checking if variable names are
    well-formed according to your coding standard, or checking if declared
    interfaces are truly implemented, and much more. Additionally, it is
    possible to write plugins to add your own checks.
