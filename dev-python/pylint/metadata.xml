  <longdescription lang="en">Pylint is a Python source code analyzer which looks for programming
		errors, helps enforcing a coding standard and sniffs for some code
		smells (as defined in Martin Fowler's Refactoring book).
		Pylint can be seen as another PyChecker since nearly all tests you can
		do with PyChecker can also be done with Pylint. However, Pylint offers
		some more features, like checking length of lines of code, checking if
		variable names are well-formed according to your coding standard, or
		checking if declared interfaces are truly implemented, and much more.
		Additionally, it is possible to write plugins to add your own checks.</longdescription>
