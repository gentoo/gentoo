		This is a small Python module that determines and returns standardized
		names for platforms, where the "standard" is Trent Mick's reasoning :)
		from experience building ActivePython on a fairly large number of
		platforms.

		The driving goal is to provide platform names that are:
		- relatively short
		- readable (as much as possible making matching the given name to an
		actually machine self-explanatory)
		- be capable enough to produce all names needed to distinguish all
		platform-specific application builds
		- generally safe for usage in filenames
		- not ugly (e.g. "MSWin32" is ugly)
