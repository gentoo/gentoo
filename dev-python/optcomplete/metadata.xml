    This Python module aims at providing almost automatically shell completion
    for any Python program that already uses the optparse module.

    This module aims at placing the shell completion routine and the option
    parsing code in a single location: in the program itself.

    The logic is that since a program already knows about its options, and in
    Python we have a standard module to specify them programmatically since
    Python-2.3 (optparse), the program itself is in the best position to suggest
    completions for an incomplete command-line to a shell that invokes it.
