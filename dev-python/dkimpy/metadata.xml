		Python module that implements DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) email
		signing and verification. It also provides helper scripts for command
		line signing and verification. As of version 0.6.0, it also supports
		the experimental Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) protocol.

		Originally developed by Greg Hewgill http://hewgill.com/pydkim/ - The
		code in this project has been modified and development work continued.
		This is now a fork of pydkim and we've renamed it dkimpy to avoid
		confusion. The original author of pydkim has confirmed he no longer
		intends to maintain it and supports this as its continuation.

		Current documentation is available online at
		https://gathman.org/pydkim/

		ARC is still in development. dkimpy 0.6.0 supports draft
		https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dmarc-arc-protocol-01 with the
		exception of requiring 1024 bit minimum key size (this matches the
		planned changes in the next update).
