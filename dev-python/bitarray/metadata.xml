  <longdescription>
This module provides an object type which efficiently represents an array of 
booleans. Bitarrays are sequence types and behave very much like usual lists. 
Eight bits are represented by one byte in a contiguous block of memory. The 
user can select between two representations; little-endian and big-endian. 
Most of the functionality is implemented in C. Methods for accessing the 
machine representation are provided. This can be useful when bit level access 
to binary files is required, such as portable bitmap image files (.pbm). Also, 
when dealing with compressed data which uses variable bit length encoding, 
you may find this module useful.
