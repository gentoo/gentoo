This is a ground-up rewrite of Perspective Broker, which itself is Twisted's
native RPC/RMI protocol (Remote Procedure Call / Remote Method Invocation).
If you have control of both ends of the wire, and are thus not constrained to
use some other protocol like HTTP/XMLRPC/CORBA/etc, you might consider using
Foolscap.

Fundamentally, Foolscap allows you to make a python object in one process
available to code in other processes, which means you can invoke its methods
remotely. This includes a data serialization layer to convey the object
graphs for the arguments and the eventual response, and an object reference
system to keep track of which objects you are connecting to. It uses a
capability-based security model, such that once you create a non-public
object, it is only accessible to clients to whom you've given the
(unguessable) FURL. You can of course publish world-visible objects that
have well-known FURLs.
