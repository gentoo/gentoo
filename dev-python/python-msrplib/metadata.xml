		Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) is a protocol for transmitting a
		series of related instant messages in the context of a session. Message
		sessions are treated like any other media stream when set up via a
		rendezvous or session creation protocol such as the Session Initiation
		Protocol (SIP).

		A series of related instant messages between two or more parties can be
		viewed as part of a "message session", that is, a conversational exchange
		of messages with a definite beginning and end. This is in contrast to
		individual messages each sent independently. Messaging schemes that track
		only individual messages can be described as "page-mode" messaging,
		whereas messaging that is part of a "session" with a definite start and
		end is called "session-mode" messaging.

		Page-mode messaging is enabled in SIP via the SIP MESSAGE method, as
		defined in RFC 3428. Session-mode messaging has a number of benefits
		over page-mode messaging, however, such as explicit rendezvous, tighter
		integration with other media-types, direct client-to-client operation,
		and brokered privacy and security.
