  <longdescription>
    Breathe provides a bridge between the Sphinx and Doxygen
    documentation systems. 
    It is an easy way to include Doxygen information in a set of
    documentation generated by Sphinx. The aim is to produce an autodoc
    like support for people who enjoy using Sphinx but work with languages
    other than Python. The system relies on the Doxygen’s xml output.
