  Envisage is a Python-based framework for building extensible
  applications, that is, applications whose functionality can be
  extended by adding "plug-ins". Envisage provides a standard
  mechanism for features to be added to an application, whether by the
  original developer or by someone else. In fact, when you build an
  application using Envisage, the entire application consists
  primarily of plug-ins. In this respect, it is similar to the Eclipse
  and Netbeans frameworks for Java applications.
