  Milk is a machine learning toolkit in Python.
  Its focus is on supervised classification with several classifiers
  available: SVMs (based on libsvm), k-NN, random forests, decision
  trees. It also performs feature selection. These classifiers can be
  combined in many ways to form different classification systems.
  For unsupervised learning, milk supports k-means clustering and
  affinity propagation.
  Milk is flexible about its inputs. It optimised for numpy arrays, but
  can often handle anything (for example, for SVMs, you can use any
  dataype and any kernel and it does the right thing).  
  There is a strong emphasis on speed and low memory usage. Therefore,
  most of the performance sensitive code is in C++. This is behind
  Python-based interfaces for convenience.
