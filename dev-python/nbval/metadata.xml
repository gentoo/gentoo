		The plugin adds functionality to py.test to recognise and collect Jupyter notebooks.
		The intended purpose of the tests is to determine whether execution of the stored
		inputs match the stored outputs of the .ipynb file. Whilst also ensuring that the
		notebooks are running without errors.

		The tests were designed to ensure that Jupyter notebooks (especially those for reference
		and documentation), are executing consistently.

		Each cell is taken as a test, a cell that doesn't reproduce the expected output will fail.
