-      description='Allow to inject warning filters during ``nosetest``.\n\nPut the same arguments as ``warnings.filterwarnings`` in ``setup.cfg``\nat the root of your project. Separated each argument by pipes ``|``, one\nfilter per line. Whitespace are stripped.\n\nfor example:\n\n::\n\n    [nosetests]\n    warningfilters=default         |.*            |DeprecationWarning |notebook.*\n                   ignore          |.*metadata.*  |DeprecationWarning |notebook.*\n                   once            |.*schema.*    |UserWarning        |nbfor.*\n                   error           |.*warn.*      |DeprecationWarning |notebook.services.contents.manager*\n\nIf you prefer another name for the configuration file, you can tell nose\nto load the configuration using the ``-c`` flag: run the tests with\n``nosetests -c nose.cfg``.\n\ndetails configuration.\n======================\n\nEach line of warning filter is separated in maximum 4 sections, that\nmatch the first 4 sections of ``filterwarnings``:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    filterwarnings(action, message="", category=Warning, module="", lineno=0, append=False)\n\nfields 2 to 4 can be omitted, ie to say 1 line can be of the following\nform:\n\n::\n\n    action\n    action| message\n    action| message | category\n    action| message | category | module\n\nthe value of each fields is treated the same as for ``filterwarnigns``\nexcept: - whitespace are trimmed. - if the ``category`` has dots, the\ncorresponding class try to be imported. If it does not have dots, the\nname is looked up in ``builtins`` or ``__builtins__``\n\ntest are failing\n================\n\nFor some reasons in some systems tests are failing; it seem that this\npackage have difficulty to self-test. That\'s likely due to the fact that\nthe tested package need to be in different namespaces, and by\nself-testing we break this assumption.\n',
