		PyFlakes is a Lint-like tool for Python, like PyChecker. It is focused
		on identifying common errors quickly without executing Python code.

		Its primary advantage over PyChecker is that it is fast. You don't have
		to sit around for minutes waiting for the checker to run; it runs on
		most large projects in only a few seconds.
