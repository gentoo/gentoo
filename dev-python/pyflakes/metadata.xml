	<longdescription>PyFlakes is a Lint-like tool for Python, like PyChecker. It is
  focused on identifying common errors quickly without executing
  Python code.
  Its primary advantage over PyChecker is that it is fast. You don't
  have to sit around for minutes waiting for the checker to run; it
  runs on most large projects in only a few seconds.</longdescription>
