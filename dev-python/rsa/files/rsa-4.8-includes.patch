Subject: [PATCH] Do not include arbitrary files in wheel

Fix the include key to apply to sdist format only.  Otherwise, the
listed files are added to the top directory of wheel as well and end up
being installed in top-level site-packages directory, e.g.:

 *  FILES:+usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/CHANGELOG.md
 *  FILES:+usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/LICENSE
 *  FILES:+usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/README.md
