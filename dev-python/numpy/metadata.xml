  <longdescription lang="en">
  NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing Python package designed to
  efficiently manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays of arbitrary
  records without sacrificing too much speed for small multi-dimensional
  arrays. There are also basic facilities for discrete fourier transform,
  basic linear algebra and random number generation.
  It is the successor of Numeric and numarray.

      Enable dynamic dispatch to additional CPU extensions not covered
      by enabled CPU_FLAGS_*.  This permits NumPy to benefit from improved
      performance when CPUs support more instruction sets, while preserving
      compatibility with the baseline set by CPU_FLAGS_*.
