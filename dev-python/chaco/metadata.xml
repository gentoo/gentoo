  Chaco is a Python plotting application toolkit and a part of
  Enthought Tool Suite. It is meant to facilitate writing plotting
  applications of all levels of complexity, from simple scripts with
  hard-coded data to large plotting programs with complex data
  interrelationships and a multitude of interactive tools. While Chaco
  generates nice static plots for publication and presentation
  purposes, its components are all designed to be work well for
  interactive data visualization.
