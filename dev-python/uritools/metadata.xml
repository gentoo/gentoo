		For various reasons, ``urllib.parse`` and its Python 2 predecessor
		``urlparse`` are not compliant with current Internet standards.  As
		stated in `Lib/urllib/parse.py
		&lt;https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.8/Lib/urllib/parse.py&gt;`_:

			RFC 3986 is considered the current standard and any future changes
			to urlparse module should conform with it.  The urlparse module is
			currently not entirely compliant with this RFC due to defacto
			scenarios for parsing, and for backward compatibility purposes,
			some parsing quirks from older RFCs are retained.

		This module aims to provide fully RFC 3986 compliant replacements for
		the most commonly used functions found in ``urllib.parse``.  It also
		includes functions for distinguishing between the different forms of
		URIs and URI references, and for conveniently creating URIs from their
		individual components.
