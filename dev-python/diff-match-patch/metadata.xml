	<longdescription lang="en">The Diff Match and Patch libraries offer robust algorithms to perform
		the operations required for synchronizing plain text.
		Diff: Compare two blocks of plain text and efficiently return a list of
		differences.
		Match: Given a search string, find its best fuzzy match in a block of
		plain text. Weighted for both accuracy and location.
		Patch: Apply a list of patches onto plain text. Use best-effort to apply
		patch even when the underlying text doesn't match.
		Diff Match and Patch libraries are currently available in Java,
		JavaScript, C++, C#, Objective C, Lua and Python, although this package
		contains only Python implementation.  Regardless of language, each
		library features the same API and the same functionality.  All versions
		also have comprehensive test harnesses.</longdescription>
