		Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for
		python.
		That is, it will recognize and "read" the text embedded in images.

		Python-tesseract is a wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine.
		It is also useful as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract, as
		it can read all image types supported by the Pillow and Leptonica
		imaging libraries, including jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, and others.
		Additionally, if used as a script, Python-tesseract will print the
		recognized text instead of writing it to a file.
