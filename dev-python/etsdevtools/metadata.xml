    The ETSDevTools project from the Enthought Tool Suite includes a
    set of packages that can be used during the development of a
    software project, for understanding, debugging, testing, and
    inspecting code: 
    * Enthought Developer Tool Suite (enthought.developer): A
      collection of utilities, designed to ease the development and
      debugging of Traits-based programs. They can be used as plug-ins
      to your Envisage application while you are developing it, and then
      removed when you are ready to release it.
    * Endo: A Traits-aware tool for processing API documentation of
      Python code. It extracts not only docstrings, but also plain
      comments that immediately precede variable assignments (both
      module-scope variables and class attributes).
    * enthought.guitest: A collection of utilities for unit testing
      user interfaces (translation of the Perl X11::GUITest and
      Win32::GuiTest modules).
    * enthought.testing: Scripts related to running unit tests, based
      on testoob, and also allowing running test suites in separate
      processes and aggregating the results.
    * enthought.debug: A collection of debugging tools, not to be
      included in production code. NOTE: These tools are functional, but
      are not being developed or supported. They have been mainly
      superceded by the tools in the Enthought Developer Tool Suite.
