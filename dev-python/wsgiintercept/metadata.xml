Testing a WSGI application normally involves starting a server at a local host 
and port, then pointing your test code to that address. Instead, this library 
lets you intercept calls to any specific host/port combination and redirect 
them into a WSGI application importable by your test program. Thus, you can 
avoid spawning multiple processes or threads to test your Web app.
