	<longdescription lang="en">Vertex is an implementation of the Q2Q protocol (sort of like P2P,
		but one better). There are a few moving parts in Vertex: PTCP is a
		protocol which is nearly identical to TCP, but which runs over
		UDP. This lets Q2Q penetrate most NAT configurations. JUICE
		([JU]ice [I]s [C]oncurrent [E]vents) is a very simple but immensely
		flexible protocol which forms the basis of the high-level aspects of
		Q2Q. vertex is a command line tool which exposes a few features
		useful in many situations (such as registration and authentication).</longdescription>
