    Like shelve, a PickleShareDB object acts like a normal dictionary.
    Unlike shelve, many processes can access the database
    simultaneously. Changing a value in database is immediately visible
    to other processes accessing the same database.
    Concurrency is possible because the values are stored in separate
    files. Hence the "database" is a directory where all files are
    governed by PickleShare.
