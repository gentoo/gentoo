    Dill extends Python's 'pickle' module for serializing and de-serializing Python
    objects to the majority of the built-in Python types.
    Dill provides the user the same interface as the 'pickle' module, and also
    includes some additional features. In addition to pickling Python objects,
    dill provides the ability to save the state of an interpreter session in a
    single command.
    Dill can be used to store Python objects to a file, but the primary usage is to
    send Python objects across the network as a byte stream.
