  <background>
    <p>Ark is a graphical file compression/decompression utility with support
      for multiple formats.

  <description>
    <p>A vulnerability was discovered in how Ark handles executable files while
      browsing a compressed archive.  A user could unintentionally execute a
      malicious script which has the executable bit set inside of the archive. 
      This is due to Ark not displaying what files are executable and running
      the associated applications for the file type upon execution.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>A remote attacker, by coercing a user to browse a malicious archive file
      within Ark and execute certain files, could execute arbitrary code with
      the privileges of the user.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All Ark users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=kde-apps/ark-16.08.3-r1"
    </code>
