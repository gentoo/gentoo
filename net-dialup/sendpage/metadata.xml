	<longdescription>To send alphanumeric pages to a pager, if an email gateway is unavailable or undesirable, 
software is needed to control a modem which will dial a "Paging Central", and deliver the pages using 
an ASCII delivery system known as "TAP".
Sendpage implements all aspects of this type of software, including an SNPP client, an SNPP server, 
a queuing engine, a modem control engine, a TAP communication system, and an email notification system.</longdescription>
