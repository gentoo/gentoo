WHAT IS DRDSL
For a DSL internet connection to work, the DSL values (VPI, VCI, VPP) of
the DSLAM are required. The DSLAM is the counterpart of the DSL modem on
the access provider end. The values thus are generally
provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

It is possible to enter the requested values from the ISP manually, but
it is much more convenient to detect them automatically with drdsl. drdsl tests
different values taken from the file drdsl.ini. Once the working
values and the corresponding controller number are found, they are written
to the adsl.conf, located in the file /etc/drdsl/adsl.conf.

Each time the pppd capi plugin is started with the "avmadsl" parameter,
the adsl.conf supplies the driver with all of the values detected and a
successfull dsl connection can be established.


REQUIREMENTS
drdsl requires an AVM DSL controller with a CAPI driver running, plus the
drdsl.ini file located at /etc/drdsl. The drdsl.ini is also
included in every DSL-Controller driver package.


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
-c  path of the drdsl.ini file
-q  quiet mode
-r  remove the files generated by drdsl
-h  short help


UPDATES AND PACKAGES
