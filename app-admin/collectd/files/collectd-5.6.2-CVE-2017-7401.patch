Subject: [PATCH] network plugin: Fix endless loop DOS in parse_packet()

When correct 'Signature part' is received by Collectd, configured without
AuthFile option, condition for endless loop occurs due to missing increase
of pointer to next unprocessed part.

This is a forward-port of #2233.

Fixes: CVE-2017-7401
Closes: #2174
Signed-off-by: Florian Forster <octo@collectd.org>
