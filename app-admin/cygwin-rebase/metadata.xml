		The rebaseall utility is a convenient way for users that suffer from the
		Cygwin rebase problem to rebase their entire system (i.e., all of their
		DLLs).  The following is a list of known Cygwin applications that are
		affected by the rebase problem:

			Apache
			Perl
			Python

		The rebase problem is due to fork() failing when it is unable to load
		DLLs in the child at the same address as in the parent.  This is caused
		by DLLs which have conflicting base addresses.
