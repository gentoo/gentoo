"stown" manages file system object mapping via symlinks. It was inspired by GNU
Stow, which I found very useful but too unwieldly for personal use. GNU Stow
relies on a number of Perl modules and can be a hassle to install on
minimalistic systems. In contrast, stown requires only Python 3.9 or newer,
without any additional dependencies.

If you are looking for a lightweight tool instead of a full-fledged symlink
farm manager, stown might be for you.
