# Config file for /etc/init.d/syslog-ng

# If you are not using network logging, this entire section should be
# commented out. Otherwise, choose one of the settings below based on
# how you are configuring your network.
#
# If you are using the net.* scripts to configure your network, you should
# set rc_need to match the interface through which your logging server
# can be reached.
#rc_need="net.eth0"
#
# If you are using an interface manager like wicd, dhcpcd in standalone
# mode, networkmanager, etc to control your interfaces, set rc_need to
# the name of that service.
# rc_need="dhcpcd"
#rc_need="networkmanager"
#
# If you are using newnet and configuring your interface statically with
# the network script, you should use this setting.
#rc_need="network"
#
# You can use this setting, but I do not recommend relying on it.
#rc_need="net"
#
# You may also want to uncomment the following if you are using network
# logging.
#rc_use="stunnel"

# For very customized setups these variables can be adjusted as needed
# but for most situations they should remain commented:
# SYSLOG_NG_CONFIGFILE=/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf
# SYSLOG_NG_STATEFILE_DIR=/var/lib/syslog-ng
# SYSLOG_NG_STATEFILE=${SYSLOG_NG_STATEFILE_DIR}/syslog-ng.persist
# SYSLOG_NG_PIDFILE_DIR=/var/run
# SYSLOG_NG_PIDFILE=${SYSLOG_NG_PIDFILE_DIR}/syslog-ng.pid
# SYSLOG_NG_GROUP=root
# SYSLOG_NG_USER=root

# Put any additional options for syslog-ng here.
# See syslog-ng(8) for more information.
