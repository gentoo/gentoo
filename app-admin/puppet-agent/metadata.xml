		Centralised configuration management for networks
		Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system
		using a cross-platform specification language that manages all the
		separate elements normally aggregated in different files, like users,
		cron jobs, and hosts, along with obviously discrete elements like
		packages, services, and files.

		Puppet's simple declarative specification language provides powerful
		classing abilities for drawing out the similarities between hosts while
		allowing them to be as specific as necessary, and it handles dependency
		and prerequisite relationships between objects clearly and explicitly.
