	<longdescription>Test suite for the PaX kernel patch
		PaX is a Linux kernel patch which adds much stricter control on how memory
		is being used by applications. A normal Linux kernel leaves the control to the
		application and does not implement any enforcement. Especially buffer overflow
		attacks benefit from the absense of kernel enforced memory control. PaX tries
		to do its best to enforce this control of memory used by applications, thereby
		making it harder to succesfully exploit buffer overflows.

		Furthermore, it adds several randomisations, which also make it harder for
		buffer overflows to succeed.

		The test programs test all this functionality, but not all PaX functionality
		is covered.

		For more information about PaX, see http://pageexec.virtualave.net/.
