		Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure
		safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service
		providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

		Terraform files describe the components needed to run a single application
		or your entire datacenter. Terraform generates an execution plan describing
		what it will do to reach the desired state, and then executes it to build
		the described infrastructure. As the configuration changes, Terraform is
		able to determine what changed and create incremental execution plans which
		can be applied.
