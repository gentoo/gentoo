	<longdescription lang="en">
	A library for programmatically editing configuration files. Augeas parses
	configuration files into a tree structure, which it exposes through its
	public API. Changes made through the API are written back to the initially
	read files.

	The transformation works very hard to preserve comments and formatting
	details. It is controlled by ``lens'' definitions that describe the file
	format and the transformation into a tree.
