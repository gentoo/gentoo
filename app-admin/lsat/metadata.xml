		Linux Security Auditing Tool (LSAT) is a post install security auditing
		tool. It is modular in design, so new features can be added quickly. It
		checks inetd entries and scans for unneeded RPM packages. It is being
		expanded to work with Linux distributions other than Red Hat, and checks
		for kernel versions.
