<longdescription lang="en">This program reads logs written by multilog (part of the
daemontools package by Dan Bernstein), discards any lines matching regular
expressions in its configuration file, and mails the rest to a configured e-mail
address. The e-mail is sent using qmail-remote directly, which requires qmail be
installed on the system but which allows multilog-watch to send mail even if the
local mail system is down.</longdescription>
