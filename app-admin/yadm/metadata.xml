	yadm is a dotfile manager that handles the hassle of synchronizing the
	dotfiles in your home folder across different workstations. It has a
	philosophy using git and getting out of git's way to ensure it does what it
	does best. What sets it apart is that it supports encryption, which enables
	you to add files like mutt configuration with passwords and host it
	publicly. It also enables you to add suffixes to your files like
	##Linux.hostname, and yadm will automatically symlink the file if you are
	on that hostname.
