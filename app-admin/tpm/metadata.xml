		tpm is a tiny shell script which is heavily inspired and
		largely compatible with pass(1). Just like pass it uses
		gpg2(1) to securely store your passwords, the major difference
		between pass and tpm is that the latter is a lot more minimal.
		Furthermore, tpm is written entirely in POSIX shell.
