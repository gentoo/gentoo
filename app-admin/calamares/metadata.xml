		Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an
		advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated
		partitioning operations. It is the first installer with an automated
		“Replace Partition” option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition
		over and over for distribution testing. Calamares is designed to be
		customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome
		patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support.
