Subject: [PATCH] Mark global variable as extern
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

GCC now defaults to -fno-common. As a result, global variable accesses
are more efficient on various targets. In C, global variables with
multiple tentative definitions now result in linker errors.

Fix #532
