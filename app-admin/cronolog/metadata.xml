		Cronolog is a simple filter program that reads log file entries from
		standard input and writes each entry to the output file specified by a
		filename template and the current date and time. When the expanded
		filename changes, the current file is closed and a new one opened.
		cronolog is intended to be used in conjunction with a Web server, such
		as Apache, to split the access log into daily or monthly logs.
