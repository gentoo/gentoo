    tmpreaper is a program that can be used to clean out temporary-file
    directories. It recursively searches the directory, refusing to chdir()
    across symlinks, and removes files that haven't been accessed in a
    user-specified amount of time. You can specify a set of files to protect
    from deletion with a shell pattern. It will not remove files owned by the
    process EUID that have the `w' bit clear, unless you ask it to, much like
    `rm -f'. `tmpreaper' will not remove symlinks, sockets, fifos, or special
    files unless given a command line option enabling it to.

    WARNING: Please do not run `tmpreaper' on `/'. There are no protections
    against this written into the program, as that would prevent it from
    functioning the way you'd expect it to in a `chroot(8)' environment.

    The daily tmpreaper run can be configured through /etc/tmpreaper.conf .
