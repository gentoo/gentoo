# /etc/locale.gen: list all of the locales you want to have on your system.
# See the locale.gen(5) man page for more details.
#
# The format of each line:
# <locale name> <charset>
#
# Where <locale name> starts with a name as found in /usr/share/i18n/locales/.
# It must be unique in the file as it is used as the key to locale variables.
# For non-default encodings, the <charset> is typically appended.
#
# Where <charset> is a charset located in /usr/share/i18n/charmaps/ (sans any
# suffix like ".gz").
#
# All blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
#
# For the default list of supported combinations, see the file:
# /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED
#
# Whenever glibc is emerged, the locales listed here will be automatically
# rebuilt for you.  After updating this file, you can simply run `locale-gen`
# yourself instead of re-emerging glibc.
