    <p>
    ProFTPD 1.2.9 introduced a vulnerability that allows CIDR-based ACLs (such
    as 10.0.0.1/24) to be bypassed. The CIDR ACLs are disregarded, with the net
    effect being similar to an "AllowAll" directive.

  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    This vulnerability may allow unauthorized files, including critical system
    files to be downloaded and/or modified, thereby allowing a potential remote
    compromise of the server.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    Users may work around the problem by avoiding use of CIDR-based ACLs.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>

    ProFTPD users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of the
    package:

    # emerge -pv "&gt;=net-ftp/proftpd-1.2.9-r2"
    # emerge "&gt;=net-ftp/proftpd-1.2.9-r2"</code>
