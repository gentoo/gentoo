# The policy section assigns significance levels to various policies.
# Keys are identifiers from the Policy Guide, values are either
# 'notice', 'warning' or 'error'.
#
# The rule of thumb is that 'error' indicates a serious problem that
# may cause serious problem to the end users and therefore should block
# committing / deployment.  'warning' should be fixed by developer
# but does not need to immediately prevent committing.
