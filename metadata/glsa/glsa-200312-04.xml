    CVS, which stands for Concurrent Versions System, is a client/server
    application which tracks changes to sets of files.  It allows multiple users
    to work concurrently on files, and then merge their changes back into the
    main tree (which can be on a remote system).  It also allows branching, or
    maintaining separate versions for files.

    Quote from ccvs.cvshome.org/servlets/NewsItemView?newsID=84:
    "Stable CVS 1.11.10 has been released. Stable releases contain only bug
    fixes from previous versions of CVS. This release fixes a security issue
    with no known exploits that could cause previous versions of CVS to attempt
    to create files and directories in the filesystem root. This release also
    fixes several issues relevant to case insensitive filesystems and some other
    bugs. We recommend this upgrade for all CVS clients and servers!"

  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Gentoo Linux machines with cvs installed should be updated to use
    dev-util/cvs-1.11.10 or higher:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    # emerge -pv '&gt;=dev-util/cvs-1.11.10'
    # emerge '&gt;=dev-util/cvs-1.11.10'
    # emerge clean</code>
