  <background>
    <p>LittleCMS, or short lcms, is a color management system for working with
      ICC profiles. It is used by many applications including GIMP and Firefox.
    </p>
  </background>
  <description>
    <p>Multiple stack-based buffer overflows and a profile parser error have
      been found in LittleCMS.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to open a
      specially crafted file containing a malicious ICC profile, possibly
      resulting in a Denial of Service condition.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All LittleCMS users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=media-libs/lcms-2.6-r1"
    </code>
    
    <p>Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
      such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying these packages.
    </p>
    
    <p>NOTE: Gentoo has discontinued support for the LittleCMS 1.9 branch. </p>
