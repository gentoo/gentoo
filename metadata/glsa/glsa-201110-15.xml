    <p>The GNU Privacy Guard, GnuPG, is a free replacement for the PGP suite of
      cryptographic software. The GPGSM utility in GnuPG is responsible for
      processing X.509 certificates, signatures and encryption as well as
      S/MIME messages. 
    </p>

  <description>
    <p>The GPGSM utility in GnuPG contains a use-after-free vulnerability that
      may be exploited when importing a crafted X.509 certificate explicitly or
      during the signature verification process. 
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>An unauthenticated remote attacker may execute arbitrary code with the
      privileges of the user running GnuPG by enticing them to import a crafted
      certificate.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All GnuPG 2.x users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=app-crypt/gnupg-2.0.16-r1"
