    <p>
    Opera fails to remove illegal characters from an URI of a link and to check
    that the target frame of a link belongs to the same website as the link.
    Opera also updates the address bar before loading a page. Additionally,
    Opera contains a certificate verification problem.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to impersonate legitimate
    websites to steal sensitive information from users. This could be done by
    obfuscating the real URI of a link or by injecting a malicious frame into
    an arbitrary frame of another browser window.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
    upgrade to the latest available version.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Opera users should upgrade to the latest stable version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=www-client/opera-7.53"
    # emerge ">=www-client/opera-7.53"</code>
