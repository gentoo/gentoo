    <p>
    FreeRADIUS is a popular open source RADIUS server.
    </p>

  <description>
    <p>
    FreeRADIUS versions below 0.9.3 are vulnerable to a heap exploit, however,
    the attack code must be in the form of a valid RADIUS packet which limits
    the possible exploits.
    </p>
    <p>
    Also corrected in the 0.9.3 release is another vulnerability which causes
    the RADIUS server to de-reference a NULL pointer and crash when an
    Access-Request packet with a Tunnel-Password is received.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could craft a RADIUS packet which would cause the RADIUS
    server to crash, or could possibly overflow the heap resulting in a system
    compromise.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    Users are encouraged to perform an 'emerge sync' and upgrade the package to
    the latest available version - 0.9.3 is available in portage and is marked
    as stable.
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    # emerge -pv '&gt;=net-dialup/freeradius-0.9.3'
    # emerge '&gt;=net-dialup/freeradius-0.9.3'
    # emerge clean</code>
