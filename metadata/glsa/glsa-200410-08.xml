  <title>ncompress: Buffer overflow</title>
  <synopsis>
    compress and uncompress, which could be used by daemon programs, contain a
    buffer overflow that could lead to remote execution of arbitrary code with
    the rights of the daemon process.

    <p>
    ncompress is a utility handling compression and decompression of
    Lempel-Ziv archives, compatible with the original *nix compress and
    uncompress utilities (.Z extensions).

  <description>
    <p>
    compress and uncompress do not properly check bounds on command line
    options, including the filename. Large parameters would trigger a
    buffer overflow.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    By supplying a carefully crafted filename or other option, an attacker
    could execute arbitrary code on the system. A local attacker could only
    execute code with his own rights, but since compress and uncompress are
    called by various daemon programs, this might also allow a remote
    attacker to execute code with the rights of the daemon making use of
    ncompress.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All ncompress users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    
    # emerge -pv &quot;&gt;=app-arch/ncompress-4.2.4-r1&quot;
    # emerge &quot;&gt;=app-arch/ncompress-4.2.4-r1&quot;</code>
