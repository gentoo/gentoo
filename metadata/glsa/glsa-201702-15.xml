  <title>OCaml: Buffer overflow and information disclosure</title>
  <synopsis>A buffer overflow in OCaml might allow remote attackers to obtain
    sensitive information or crash an OCaml-based application.

  <affected>
    <package name="dev-lang/ocaml" auto="yes" arch="*">

  <background>
    <p>OCaml is a high-level, strongly-typed, functional, and object-oriented
      programming language from the ML family of languages.
    </p>

  <description>
    <p>It was discovered that OCaml was vulnerable to a runtime bug that, on
      64-bit platforms, causes size arguments to internal memmove calls to be
      sign-extended from 32- to 64-bits before being passed to the memmove
      function. This leads to arguments between 2GiB and 4GiB being interpreted
      as larger than they are (specifically, a bit below 2^64), causing a
      buffer overflow. Further, arguments between 4GiB and 6GiB are interpreted
      as 4GiB smaller than they should be causing a possible information leak.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>A remote attacker, able to interact with an OCaml-based application,
      could possibly obtain sensitive information or cause a Denial of Service
      condition.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All OCaml users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=dev-lang/ocam-4.04.0"
    </code>
    
    <p>Packages which depend on OCaml may need to be recompiled. Tools such as
      qdepends (included in app-portage/portage-utils) may assist in
      identifying these packages:
    </p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --oneshot --ask --verbose $(qdepends -CQ dev-lang/ocaml | sed
      's/^/=/')
    </code>
