    <p>
    Mozilla Firefox is a redesign of the Mozilla Navigator component. The
    goal is to produce a cross-platform stand-alone browser application.

    The following vulnerabilities have been reported:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Benjamin Smedberg discovered that chrome URL's could be made to
    reference remote files.</li>
    <li>Developers in the Mozilla community
    looked for and fixed several crash bugs to improve the stability of
    Mozilla clients.</li>
    <li>"shutdown" reports that cross-site scripting
    (XSS) attacks could be performed using the construct
    XPCNativeWrapper(window).Function(...), which created a function that
    appeared to belong to the window in question even after it had been
    navigated to the target site.</li>
    <li>"shutdown" reports that scripts
    granting the UniversalBrowserRead privilege can leverage that into the
    equivalent of the far more powerful UniversalXPConnect since they are
    allowed to "read" into a privileged context.</li>
    <li>"moz_bug_r_a4"
    reports that A malicious Proxy AutoConfig (PAC) server could serve a
    PAC script that can execute code with elevated privileges by setting
    the required FindProxyForURL function to the eval method on a
    privileged object that leaked into the PAC sandbox.</li>
    <li>"moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that Named JavaScript functions have a
    parent object created using the standard Object() constructor
    (ECMA-specified behavior) and that this constructor can be redefined by
    script (also ECMA-specified behavior).</li>
    <li>Igor Bukanov and
    shutdown found additional places where an untimely garbage collection
    could delete a temporary object that was in active use.</li>
    <li>Georgi
    Guninski found potential integer overflow issues with long strings in
    the toSource() methods of the Object, Array and String objects as well
    as string function arguments.</li>
    <li>H. D. Moore reported a testcase
    that was able to trigger a race condition where JavaScript garbage
    collection deleted a temporary variable still being used in the
    creation of a new Function object.</li>
    <li>A malicious page can hijack
    native DOM methods on a document object in another domain, which will
    run the attacker's script when called by the victim page.</li>
    <li>Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability which is caused due
    to an memory corruption error within the handling of simultaneously
    happening XPCOM events. This leads to use of a deleted timer
    object.</li>
    <li>An anonymous researcher for TippingPoint and the Zero
    Day Initiative showed that when used in a web page Java would reference
    properties of the window.navigator object as it started up.</li>
    <li>Thilo Girmann discovered that in certain circumstances a JavaScript
    reference to a frame or window was not properly cleared when the
    referenced content went away.</li>
    </ul>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A user can be enticed to open specially crafted URLs, visit webpages
    containing malicious JavaScript or execute a specially crafted script.
    These events could lead to the execution of arbitrary code, or the
    installation of malware on the user's computer.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5.0.5"</code>
    <p>
    Users of the binary package should upgrade as well:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.5.0.5"</code>
  </resolution>
