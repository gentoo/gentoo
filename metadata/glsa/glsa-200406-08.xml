    <p>
    By enticing a user to read a specially crafted e-mail, an attacker can
    execute arbitrary scripts running in the context of the victim's
    browser. This could lead to a compromise of the user's webmail account,
    cookie theft, etc.
    </p>
  </impact>

    There is no known workaround at this time.

    All SquirrelMail users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

    <code>
    # emerge sync
    
    # emerge -pv &quot;&gt;=mail-client/squirrelmail-1.4.3&quot;
    # emerge &quot;&gt;=mail-client/squirrelmail-1.4.3&quot;</code>
