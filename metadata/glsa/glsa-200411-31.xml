  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could setup a malicious server and entice a user to
    retrieve files from that server using ProZilla. This could lead to the
    execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the user running
    ProZilla.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    Currently, there is no released version of ProZilla that contains a fix
    for these issues. The original author did not respond to our queries,
    the code contains several other problems and more secure alternatives
    exist. Therefore, the ProZilla package has been hard-masked prior to
    complete removal from Portage, and current users are advised to unmerge
    the package.
