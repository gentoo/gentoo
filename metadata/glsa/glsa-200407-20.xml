    <p>
    Subversion is an advanced version control system, similar to CVS, which
    supports additional functionality such as the ability to move, copy and
    delete files and directories. A Subversion server may be run as an
    Apache module, a standalone server (svnserve), or on-demand over ssh (a
    la CVS' ":ext:" protocol). The mod_authz_svn Apache module works with
    Subversion in Apache to limit access to parts of Subversion
    repositories based on policy set by the administrator.

    <p>
    Users with write access to part of a Subversion repository may bypass
    read restrictions on any part of that repository. This can be done
    using an "svn copy" command to copy the portion of a repository the
    user wishes to read into an area where they have write access.
    </p>
    <p>
    Since copies are versioned, any such copy attempts will be readily
    apparent.
    </p>

  <impact type="low">
    <p>
    This is a low-risk vulnerability. It affects only users of Subversion
    who are running servers inside Apache and using mod_authz_svn.
    Additionally, this vulnerability may be exploited only by users with
    write access to some portion of a repository.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    Keep sensitive content separated into different Subversion
    repositories, or disable the Apache Subversion server and use svnserve
    instead.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Subversion users should upgrade to the latest available version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    
    # emerge -pv &quot;&gt;=dev-util/subversion-1.0.6&quot;
    # emerve &quot;&gt;=dev-util/subversion-1.0.6&quot;</code>
  </resolution>
