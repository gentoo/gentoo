    <p>
    rgod discovered that the Cacti cmd.php and copy_cacti_user.php scripts
    do not properly control access to the command shell, and are remotely
    accessible by unauthenticated users. This allows SQL injection via
    cmd.php and copy_cacti_user.php URLs. Further, the results from the
    injected SQL query are not properly sanitized before being passed to a
    command shell. The vulnerabilities require that the
    "register_argc_argv" option is enabled, which is the Gentoo default.
    Also, a number of similar problems in other scripts were reported.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    These vulnerabilties can result in the execution of arbitrary shell
    commands or information disclosure via crafted SQL queries.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Cacti users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose &quot;&gt;=net-analyzer/cacti-0.8.6i-r1&quot;</code>
  </resolution>
