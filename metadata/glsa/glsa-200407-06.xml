    libpng is a standard library used to process PNG (Portable Network
    Graphics) images. It is used by several other programs, including web
    browsers and potentially server processes.

    <p>
    Due to a wrong calculation of loop offset values, libpng contains a buffer
    overflow vulnerability on the row buffers. This vulnerability was initially
    patched in January 2003 but since it has been discovered that libpng
    contains the same vulnerability in two other places.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause programs linked
    against the library to crash or execute arbitrary code with the permissions
    of the user running the vulnerable program, which could be the root user.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
    upgrade to the latest available version.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All libpng users should upgrade to the latest stable version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=media-libs/libpng-1.2.5-r7"
    # emerge ">=media-libs/libpng-1.2.5-r7"</code>
    <p>
    You should also run revdep-rebuild to rebuild any packages that depend on
    older versions of libpng :
    </p>
    <code>
    # revdep-rebuild</code>
