  <impact type="normal">
    <p>A context-dependent attacker could entice a user to load specially
      crafted text using an application linked against Pango, possibly
      resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
      process or a Denial of Service condition.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All Pango users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=x11-libs/pango-1.28.3-r1"
    </code>
    
    <p>Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
      such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these packages.
    </p>
    
    <p>NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
      available since March 18, 2011. It is likely that your system is already
      no longer affected by this issue.
