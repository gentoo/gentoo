    <p>
    UUDeview is a program which is used to transmit binary files over the
    Internet in a text-only format. It is commonly used for email and Usenet
    attachments. It supports multiple encoding formats, including Base64,
    BinHex and UUEncoding.

  <description>
    <p>
    By decoding a MIME archive with excessively long strings for various
    parameters, it is possible to crash UUDeview, or cause it to execute
    arbitrary code.
    </p>
    <p>
    This vulnerability was originally reported by iDEFENSE as part of a WinZip
    advisory [ Reference: 1 ].
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    An attacker could create a specially-crafted MIME file and send it via
    email. When recipient decodes the file, UUDeview may execute arbitrary code
    which is embedded in the MIME file, thus granting the attacker access to
    the recipient's account.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. As a result, a software upgrade
    is required and users should upgrade to uudeview 0.5.20.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All users should upgrade to uudeview 0.5.20:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    # emerge -pv ">=app-text/uudeview-0.5.20"
    # emerge ">=app-text/uudeview-0.5.20"
    </code>
