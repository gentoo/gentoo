  <background>
    <p>GNU Wget is a free software package for retrieving files using HTTP,
      HTTPS and FTP, the most widely-used Internet protocols. 
    </p>
  </background>
  <description>
    <p>It was discovered that Wget was unsafely trusting server-provided
      filenames. This allowed attackers to overwrite or create files on the
      user's system by sending a redirect from the expected URL to another URL
      specifying the targeted file.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to create or overwrite
      local files by enticing the user to open an attacker controlled URL,
      possibly leading to execution of arbitrary code.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All Wget users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=net-misc/wget-1.12-r2"
    </code>
    
    <p>NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
      available since September 19, 2010. It is likely that your system is
      already no longer affected by this issue.
