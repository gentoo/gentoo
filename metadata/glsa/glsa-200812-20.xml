    <p>
    phpCollab is a web-enabled groupware and project management software
    written in PHP. It uses SQL-based database backends.

    <p>
    Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in phpCollab:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>rgod reported that data sent to general/sendpassword.php via the
    loginForm parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in an
    SQL statement (CVE-2006-1495).</li>
    <li>Christian Hoffmann of Gentoo
    Security discovered multiple vulnerabilities where input is
    insufficiently sanitized before being used in an SQL statement, for
    instance in general/login.php via the loginForm parameter.
    (CVE-2008-4303).</li>
    <li>Christian Hoffmann also found out that the
    variable $SSL_CLIENT_CERT in general/login.php is not properly
    sanitized before being used in a shell command. (CVE-2008-4304).</li>
    <li>User-supplied data to installation/setup.php is not checked before
    being written to include/settings.php which is executed later. This
    issue was reported by Christian Hoffmann as well (CVE-2008-4305).</li>
    </ul>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    These vulnerabilities enable remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL
    statements and PHP code. NOTE: Some of the SQL injection
    vulnerabilities require the php.ini option "magic_quotes_gpc" to be
    disabled. Furthermore, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary
    shell commands if "register_globals" is enabled, "magic_quotes_gpc" is
    disabled, the PHP OpenSSL extension is not installed or loaded and the
    file "installation/setup.php" has not been deleted after installation.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    phpCollab has been removed from the Portage tree. We recommend that
    users unmerge phpCollab:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --unmerge &quot;www-apps/phpcollab&quot;</code>
  </resolution>
