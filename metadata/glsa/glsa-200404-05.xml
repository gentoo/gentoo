  <description>
    <p>
    <i>racoon</i> (a utility in the ipsec-tools package) does not verify digital
    signatures on Phase1 packets.  This means  that anybody holding the correct
    X.509 certificate would be able to establish a connection, even if they did
    not have the corresponding private key.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    Since digital signatures are not verified by the <i>racoon</i> tool, an attacker may
	be able to connect to the VPN gateway and/or execute a man-in-the-middle attack.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    A workaround is not currently known for this issue. All users are advised
    to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    ipsec-tools users should upgrade to version 0.2.5 or later:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
 
    # emerge -pv ">=net-firewall/ipsec-tools-0.2.5"
