    <p>
    Multiple format string vulnerabilities and a heap overflow vulnerability
    were discovered in the code of the neon library (GLSA 200405-01 and
    200405-13). Current versions of the tla package include their own version
    of this library.

  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    When connected to a malicious WebDAV server, these vulnerabilities could
    allow execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the user running tla.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All users of tla should upgrade to the latest stable version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=dev-util/tla-1.2-r2"
    # emerge ">=dev-util/tla-1.2-r2"</code>
