  <title>Ruby: CGI::Session creates files insecurely</title>
  <synopsis>
    When used for CGI scripting, Ruby creates session files in /tmp with the
    permissions of the default umask. Depending on that umask, local users may
    be able to read sensitive data stored in session files.

    <p>
    Ruby is an Object Oriented, interpreted scripting language used for many
    system scripting tasks. It can also be used for CGI web applications.

  <description>
    <p>
    The CGI::Session::FileStore implementation (and presumably
    CGI::Session::PStore), which allow data associated with a particular
    Session instance to be written to a file, writes to a file in /tmp with no
    regard for secure permissions. As a result, the file is left with whatever
    the default umask permissions are, which commonly would allow other local
    users to read the data from that session file.

  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    Depending on the default umask, any data stored using these methods could
    be read by other users on the system.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    By changing the default umask on the system to not permit read access to
    other users (e.g. 0700), one can prevent these files from being readable by
    other users.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Ruby users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=dev-lang/ruby-your_version"
    # emerge ">=dev-lang/ruby-your_version"</code>
  </resolution>
