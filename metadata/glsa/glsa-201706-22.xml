  <description>
    <p>It was found that an unproportionate amount of memory is allocated when
      parsing crafted certificates in libskba, which may lead to Denial of
      Service condition.
    </p>
    
    <p>Moreover in libksba 1.3.4, allocated memory is uninitialized and could
      potentially contain sensitive data left in freed memory block.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>A remote attacker, able to interact with an libksba-based application,
      could possibly obtain sensitive information or cause a Denial of Service
      condition.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
