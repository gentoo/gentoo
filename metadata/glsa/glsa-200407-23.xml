    <p>
    Ulf Harnhammar discovered two buffer overflows in the sox and play
    commands when handling WAV files with specially crafted header fields.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    By enticing a user to play or convert a specially crafted WAV file an
    attacker could execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
    running SoX.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
    upgrade to the latest available version of SoX.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All SoX users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge sync
    
    # emerge -pv &quot;&gt;=media-sound/sox-12.17.4-r2&quot;
    # emerge &quot;&gt;=media-sound/sox-12.17.4-r2&quot;</code>
