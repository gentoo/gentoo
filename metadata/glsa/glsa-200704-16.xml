  <background>
    <p>
    Aircrack-ng is an 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys cracking program that can
    recover keys once enough data packets have been captured.

  <description>
    <p>
    Jonathan So reported that the airodump-ng module does not correctly
    check the size of 802.11 authentication packets before copying them
    into a buffer.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could trigger a stack-based buffer overflow by
    sending a specially crafted 802.11 authentication packet to a user
    running airodump-ng with the -w (--write) option. This could lead to
    the remote execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
    running airodump-ng, which is typically the root user.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Aircrack-ng users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose &quot;&gt;=net-wireless/aircrack-ng-0.7-r2&quot;</code>
