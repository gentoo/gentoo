    <p>
    Poppler is a cross-platform PDF rendering library originally based on
    Xpdf.

  <description>
    <p>
    Poppler and Xpdf are vulnerable to an integer overflow in the
    StreamPredictor::StreamPredictor function, and a stack overflow in the
    StreamPredictor::getNextLine function. The original vulnerability was
    discovered by Maurycy Prodeus. Note: Gentoo's version of Xpdf is
    patched to use the Poppler library, so the update to Poppler will also
    fix Xpdf.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    By enticing a user to view a specially crafted program with a
    Poppler-based PDF viewer such as Gentoo's Xpdf, Epdfview, or Evince, a
    remote attacker could cause an overflow, potentially resulting in the
    execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
    application.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Poppler users should upgrade to the latest version of Poppler:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose &quot;&gt;=app-text/poppler-0.5.4-r2&quot;</code>
  </resolution>
