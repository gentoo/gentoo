  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially-crafted
      TIFF/JPEG/BMP file, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All Libgdiplus users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=dev-dotnet/libgdiplus-2.6.7-r1"
    </code>
    
    <p>Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
      such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these packages.
    </p>
    
    <p>NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
      available since September 12, 2010. It is likely that your system is
      already no longer affected by this issue.
