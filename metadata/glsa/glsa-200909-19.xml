    <p>
    Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP
    server. It includes support for Trivial FTP (TFTP).
    </p>
  </background>
  <description>
    <p>
    Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in the TFTP functionality
    included in Dnsmasq:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Pablo Jorge and Alberto Solino
    discovered a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2009-2957).</li>
    <li>An
    anonymous researcher reported a NULL pointer reference
    (CVE-2009-2958).</li>
    </ul>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A remote attacker in the local network could exploit these
    vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted TFTP requests to a machine
    running Dnsmasq, possibly resulting in the remote execution of
    arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the daemon, or a
    Denial of Service. NOTE: The TFTP server is not enabled by default.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    You can disable the TFTP server either at buildtime by not enabling the
    "tftp" USE flag, or at runtime. Make sure "--enable-tftp" is not set in
    the DNSMASQ_OPTS variable in the /etc/conf.d/dnsmasq file and
    "enable-tftp" is not set in /etc/dnsmasq.conf, either of which would
    enable TFTP support if it is compiled in.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Dnsmasq users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=net-dns/dnsmasq-2.5.0"</code>
  </resolution>
