  <description>

    handles the HTTP connections, the GTK interface, and the CDDB querying
    mechanism.

  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    An attacker could exploit the first vulnerability by enticing a user to
    load a malicious URL resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with
    the permissions of the user running AlsaPlayer.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    AlsaPlayer has been masked in Portage pending the resolution of these
    issues. AlsaPlayer users are advised to uninstall the package until
    further notice:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --ask --unmerge &quot;media-sound/alsaplayer&quot;</code>
