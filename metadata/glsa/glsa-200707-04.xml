  <title>GNU C Library: Integer overflow</title>
  <synopsis>
    An integer overflow in the dynamic loader, ld.so, could result in the
    execution of arbitrary code with escalated privileges.

    <p>
    The GNU C library is the standard C library used by Gentoo Linux
    systems. It provides programs with basic facilities and interfaces to
    system calls. ld.so is the dynamic linker which prepares dynamically
    linked programs for execution by resolving runtime dependencies and
    related functions.

  <description>
    <p>
    Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Team discovered a flaw in
    the handling of the hardware capabilities mask by the dynamic loader.
    If a mask is specified with a high population count, an integer
    overflow could occur when allocating memory.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    As the hardware capabilities mask is honored by the dynamic loader
    during the execution of suid and sgid programs, in theory this
    vulnerability could result in the execution of arbitrary code with root
    privileges. This update is provided as a precaution against currently
    unknown attack vectors.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose &quot;&gt;=sys-libs/glibc-2.5-r4&quot;</code>
  </resolution>
