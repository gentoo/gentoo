  <description>
    <p>
    Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the implimentation of protocol
    H.323 contained in pwlib. Most of the vulnerabilies are in the parsing of
    ASN.1 elements which would allow an attacker to use a maliciously crafted
    ASN.1 element to cause unpredictable behavior in pwlib.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    An attacker may cause a denial of service condition or cause a buffer
    overflow that would allow arbitrary code to be executed with root
    privileges.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    Blocking ports 1719 and 1720 may reduce the likelihood of an attack. All
    users are advised to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All pwlib users are advised to upgrade to version 1.5.2-r3 or later:
    </p>
