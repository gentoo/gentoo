  <impact type="low">
    <p>
    By enticing a user to read a specially-crafted e-mail or using a
    manipulated URL, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts running in
    the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to a compromise of
    the user's webmail account, cookie theft, etc.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All SquirrelMail users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=mail-client/squirrelmail-1.4.4"</code>
    <p>
    Note: Users with the vhosts USE flag set should manually use
    webapp-config to finalize the update.
    </p>
