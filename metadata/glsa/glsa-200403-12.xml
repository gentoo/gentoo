  <affected>
    <package name="net-nds/openldap" auto="yes" arch="*">

    <p>
    OpenLDAP is a suite of LDAP-related application and development tools.
    It includes slapd (the standalone LDAP server), slurpd (the standalone
    LDAP replication server), and various LDAP libraries, utilities and
    example clients.
    </p>
  </background>
  <description>
    <p>
    A password extended operation (password EXOP) which fails will cause
    the slapd server to free() an uninitialized pointer, possibly resulting
    in a segfault. This only affects servers using the back-ldbm backend.
    </p>
    <p>
    Such a crash is not guaranteed with every failed operation, however, it
    is possible.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    An attacker (or indeed, a normal user) may crash the OpenLDAP server,
    creating a Denial of Service condition.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    A workaround is not currently known for this issue. All users are
    advised to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    OpenLDAP users should upgrade to version 2.1.13 or later:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    
    # emerge -pv &quot;&gt;=net-nds/openldap-2.1.13&quot;
    # emerge &quot;&gt;=net-nds/openldap-2.1.13&quot;</code>
  </resolution>
