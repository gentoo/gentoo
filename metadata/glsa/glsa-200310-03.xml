    The Apache HTTP Server is one of the most popular web servers on the
    Internet.

  <description>
    <p>
    Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in mod_alias and mod_rewrite allow
    attackers who can create or edit configuration files including .htaccess
    files, to cause a denial of service and execute arbitrary code via a regular
    expression containing more than 9 captures.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    An attacker may cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with the
    privileges of the user that is running apache.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time, other than to disable both
    mod_alias and mod_rewrite.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
    net-misc/apache 1.x upgrade:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    # emerge -pv apache
    # emerge '&gt;=www-servers/apache-1.3.29'
    # emerge clean
    # /etc/init.d/apache restart</code>
  </resolution>
