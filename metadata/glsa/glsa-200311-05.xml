    <p>
    Ethereal is a popular network protocol analyzer.

  <description>
    <p>
    Ethereal contains buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the GTP, ISAKMP, and
    MEGACO protocol dissectors, and a heap overflow vulnerability in the SOCKS
    protocol dissector, which could cause Ethereal to crash or to execute
    arbitrary code.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could craft a malformed packet which would cause Ethereal
    to crash or run arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running
    Ethereal.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time, other than to disable the GTP,
    ISAKMP, MEGACO, and SOCKS protocol dissectors.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    It is recommended that all Gentoo Linux users who are running
    net-analyzer/ethereal 0.9.x upgrade:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    # emerge -pv '&gt;=net-analyzer/ethereal-0.9.16'
    # emerge '&gt;=net-analyzer/ethereal-0.9.16'
    # emerge clean</code>
