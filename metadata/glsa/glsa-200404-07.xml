    <p>
    "Clam AntiVirus is a GPL anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. The main purpose
    of this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
    scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded
    daemon, a command line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via
    Internet. The programs are based on a shared library distributed with
    the Clam AntiVirus package, which you can use with your own software.
    Most importantly, the virus database is kept up to date."

    <p>
    Certain types of RAR archives, including those created by variants of
    the W32.Beagle.A@mm worm, may cause clamav to crash when it attempts to
    process them.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    This vulnerability causes a Denial of Service in the clamav process.
    Depending on	configuration, this may cause dependent services such as
    mail to fail as well.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
