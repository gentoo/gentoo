    <p>
    Squid is a full-featured Web Proxy Cache designed to run on Unix systems.
    It supports proxying and caching of HTTP, FTP, and other URLs, as well as
    SSL support, cache hierarchies, transparent caching, access control lists
    and many other features.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    If Squid is configured to use NTLM authentication, an attacker could
    exploit this vulnerability by sending a very long password. This could lead
    to arbitrary code execution with the permissions of the user running Squid.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
    upgrade to the latest available version.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Squid users should upgrade to the latest stable version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=net-proxy/squid-2.5.5-r2"
    # emerge ">=net-proxy/squid-2.5.5-r2"</code>
