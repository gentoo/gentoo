  <description>
    <p>
    Usermin contains two security vulnerabilities. One fails to properly
    sanitize email messages that contain malicious HTML or script code and
    the other could allow an attacker to lock out a valid user by sending
    an invalid username and password.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    By sending a specially crafted e-mail, an attacker can execute
    arbitrary scripts running in the context of the victim's browser. This
    can be lead to cookie theft and potentially to compromise of user
    accounts. Furthermore, an attacker could lock out legitimate users by
    sending invalid login information.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
    upgrade to the latest available version.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    Usermin users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    
    # emerge -pv &quot;&gt;=app-admin/usermin-1.080&quot;
    # emerge &quot;&gt;=app-admin/usermin-1.080&quot;</code>
