    <p>
    According to <uri link="http://www.webdav.org/cadaver">http://www.webdav.org/cadaver</uri>,
    cadaver is a command-line WebDAV client for Unix. It supports file upload,
    download, on-screen display, namespace operations (move/copy), collection
    creation and deletion, and locking operations.

  <description>
    <p>
    Cadaver code includes the neon library, which in versions 0.24.4 and
    previous is vulnerable to multiple format string attacks. The latest
    version of cadaver uses version 0.24.5 of the neon library, which makes it
    immune to this vulnerability.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    When using cadaver to connect to an untrusted WebDAV server, this
    vulnerability can allow a malicious remote server to execute arbitrary code
    on the client with the rights of the user using cadaver.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    A workaround is not currently known for this issue. All users are advised
    to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    cadaver users should upgrade to version 0.22.1 or later:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv "&gt;=net-misc/cadaver-0.22.1"
    # emerge "&gt;=net-misc/cadaver-0.22.1"</code>
  </resolution>
