    <p>
    NetHack is the classic single player dungeon exploration game. Slash'EM
    and Falcon's Eye are NetHack variants.
    </p>

  <description>
    <p>
    NetHack, Slash'EM and Falcon's Eye have been found to be incompatible
    with the system used for managing games on Gentoo Linux. As a result,
    they cannot be played securely on systems with multiple users.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A local user who is a member of group "games" may be able to modify the
    state data used by NetHack, Slash'EM or Falcon's Eye to trigger the
    execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of other players.
    Additionally, the games may create save game files in a manner not
    suitable for use on Gentoo Linux, potentially allowing a local user to
    create or overwrite files with the permissions of other players.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    Do not add untrusted users to the "games" group.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    NetHack has been masked in Portage pending the resolution of these
    issues. Vulnerable NetHack users are advised to uninstall the package
    until further notice.
