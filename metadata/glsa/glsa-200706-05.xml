    <p>
    ClamAV is a GPL virus scanner.

  <description>
    <p>
    Several vulnerabilities were discovered in ClamAV by various
    researchers:
    </p>
    <ul><li>Victor Stinner (INL) discovered that the OLE2
    parser may enter in an infinite loop (CVE-2007-2650).</li>
    <li>A
    boundary error was also reported by an anonymous researcher in the file
    unsp.c, which might lead to a buffer overflow (CVE-2007-3023).</li>
    <li>The file unrar.c contains a heap-based buffer overflow via a
    modified vm_codesize value from a RAR file (CVE-2007-3123).</li>
    <li>The RAR parsing engine can be bypassed via a RAR file with a header
    flag value of 10 (CVE-2007-3122).</li>
    <li>The cli_gentempstream()
    function from clamdscan creates temporary files with insecure
    permissions (CVE-2007-3024).</li>
    </ul>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could send a specially crafted file to the scanner,
    possibly triggering one of the vulnerabilities. The two buffer
    overflows are reported to only cause Denial of Service. This would lead
    to a Denial of Service by CPU consumption or a crash of the scanner.
    The insecure temporary file creation vulnerability could be used by a
    local user to access sensitive data.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose &quot;&gt;=app-antivirus/clamav-0.90.3&quot;</code>
  </resolution>
