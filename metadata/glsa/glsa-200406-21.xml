  <title>mit-krb5: Multiple buffer overflows in krb5_aname_to_localname</title>
  <synopsis>
    mit-krb5 contains multiple buffer overflows in the function
    krb5_aname_to_localname(). This could potentially lead to a complete remote
    system compromise.

  <description>
    <p>
    The library function krb5_aname_to_localname() contains multiple buffer
    overflows. This is only exploitable if explicit mapping or rules-based
    mapping is enabled. These are not enabled as default.
    </p>
    <p>
    With explicit mapping enabled, an attacker must authenticate using a
    principal name listed in the explicit mapping list.
    </p>
    <p>
    With rules-based mapping enabled, an attacker must first be able to create
    arbitrary principal names either in the local realm Kerberos realm or in a
    remote realm from which the local realm's service are reachable by
    cross-realm authentication.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    An attacker could use these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code with
    the permissions of the user running mit-krb5, which could be the root user.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
    upgrade to the latest available version.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    mit-krb5 users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv "&gt;=app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.3.3-r1"
    # emerge "&gt;=app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.3.3-r1"</code>
