  <title>ipsec-tools and iputils contain a remote DoS vulnerability</title>
  <synopsis>
    racoon, which is included in the ipsec-tools and iputils packages in
    Portage, does not check the length of ISAKMP headers. Attackers may be able
    to craft an ISAKMP header of sufficient length to consume all available
    system resoources, causing a Denial of Service.

    "IPsec-Tools is a port of KAME's IPsec utilities to the Linux-2.6 IPsec
    implementation."

  <description>
    <p>
    When racoon receives an ISAKMP header, it allocates memory based on the
    length of the header field. Thus, an attacker may be able to cause a Denial
    of Services by creating a header that is large enough to consume all
    available system resources.

  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    This vulnerability may allow an attacker to remotely cause a Denial of
    Service.
