  <title>GnuPG: Multiple vulnerabilities</title>
  <synopsis>
    GnuPG is vulnerable to a buffer overflow and an erroneous function pointer
    dereference that can result in the execution of arbitrary code.

    of cryptographic software.

    <p>
    Hugh Warrington has reported a boundary error in GnuPG, in the
    "ask_outfile_name()" function from openfile.c: the
    make_printable_string() function could return a string longer than
    expected. Additionally, Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Security Team
    reported a design error in which a function pointer can be incorrectly
    dereferenced.
    </p>

  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could entice a user to interactively use GnuPG on a
    crafted file and trigger the boundary error, which will result in a
    buffer overflow. They could also entice a user to process a signed or
    encrypted file with gpg or gpgv, possibly called through another
    application like a mail client, to trigger the dereference error. Both
    of these vulnerabilities would result in the execution of arbitrary
    code with the permissions of the user running GnuPG. gpg-agent, gpgsm
    and other tools are not affected.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All GnuPG users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose &quot;=app-crypt/gnupg-1.4*&quot;</code>
  </resolution>
