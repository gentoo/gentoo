    Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in' files
    which is often used in conjuction with Autoconf and other GNU Autotools
    to ease portability among applications. It also provides a standardized
    and light way of writing complex Makefiles through the use of many
    built-in macros.

    <p>
    Automake may be vulnerable to a symbolic link attack which may allow an
    attacker to modify data or escalate their privileges. This is due to
    the insecure way Automake creates directories during compilation. An
    attacker may be able to create symbolic links in the place of files
    contained in the affected directories, which may potentially lead to
    elevated privileges due to modification of data.
