    Honeyd is a virtual honeypot daemon that can simulate virtual hosts on
    unallocated IP addresses.

  <description>
    <p>
    A bug in handling NMAP fingerprints caused Honeyd to reply to TCP
    packets with both the SYN and RST flags set.  Watching for replies, it is
    possible to detect IP addresses simulated by Honeyd.

  <impact type="low">
    <p>
    Although there are no public exploits known for Honeyd, the detection
    of Honeyd IP addresses may in some cases be undesirable.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    Honeyd 0.8 has been released along with an advisory to address this 
    issue. In addition, Honeyd 0.8 drops privileges if permitted by the 
    configuration file and contains command line flags to force dropping 
    of privileges.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All users are recommended to update to honeyd version 0.8:
    </p>
    <code>
    $> emerge sync
    $> emerge -pv ">=net-analyzer/honeyd-0.8"
    $> emerge ">=net-analyzer/honeyd-0.8"</code>
