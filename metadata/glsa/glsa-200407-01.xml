  <title>Esearch: Insecure temp file handling</title>
  <synopsis>
    The eupdatedb utility in esearch creates a file in /tmp without first
    checking for symlinks. This makes it possible for any user to create
    arbitrary files.

  <background>
    <p>
    Esearch is a replacement for the Portage command "emerge search". It
    uses an index to speed up searching of the Portage tree.

    <p>
    The eupdatedb utility uses a temporary file (/tmp/esearchdb.py.tmp) to
    indicate that the eupdatedb process is running. When run, eupdatedb
    checks to see if this file exists, but it does not check to see if it
    is a broken symlink. In the event that the file is a broken symlink,
    the script will create the file pointed to by the symlink, instead of
    printing an error and exiting.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    An attacker could create a symlink from /tmp/esearchdb.py.tmp to a
    nonexistent file (such as /etc/nologin), and the file will be created
    the next time esearchdb is run.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All users should upgrade to
    the latest available version of esearch.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All users should upgrade to the latest available version of esearch, as
    follows:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    
    # emerge -pv &quot;&gt;=app-portage/esearch-0.6.2&quot;
    # emerge &quot;&gt;=app-portage/esearch-0.6.2&quot;</code>
