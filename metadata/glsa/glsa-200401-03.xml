    The Apache Foundation has reported that mod_python may be prone to
    Denial of Service attacks when handling a malformed
    query. Mod_python 2.7.9 was released to fix the vulnerability,
    however, because the vulnerability has not been fully fixed,
    version 2.7.10 has been released.

    Users of mod_python 3.0.4 are not affected by this vulnerability.
