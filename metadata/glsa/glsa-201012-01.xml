    Multiple vulnerabilities were found in Chromium. For further
    information please consult the release notes referenced below.
    </p>

  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could trick a user to perform a set of UI actions
    that trigger a possibly exploitable crash, leading to execution of
    arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.
    </p>
    <p>
    It was also possible for an attacker to entice a user to visit a
    specially-crafted web page that would trigger one of the
    vulnerabilities, leading to execution of arbitrary code within the
    confines of the sandbox, successful Cross-Site Scripting attacks,
    violation of the same-origin policy, successful website spoofing
    attacks, information leak, or a Denial of Service. An attacker could
    also trick a user to perform a set of UI actions that might result in a
    successful website spoofing attack.
    </p>
    <p>
    Multiple bugs in the sandbox could result in a sandbox escape.
    </p>
    <p>
    Multiple UI bugs could lead to information leak and successful website
    spoofing attacks.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Chromium users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=www-client/chromium-8.0.552.224"</code>
  </resolution>
