  <synopsis>

    <p>
    CSTeX is a TeX distribution with Czech and Slovak support. It is used
    for creating and manipulating LaTeX documents.

  <description>
    <p>
    Multiple issues were found in the teTeX 2 codebase that CSTeX builds
    upon (GLSA 200709-17, GLSA 200711-26). CSTeX also includes vulnerable
    code from the GD library (GLSA 200708-05), from Xpdf (GLSA 200709-12,
    GLSA 200711-22) and from T1Lib (GLSA 200710-12).
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    Remote attackers could possibly execute arbitrary code and local
    attackers could possibly overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges
    of the user running CSTeX via multiple vectors.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    CSTeX is not maintained upstream, so the package was masked in Portage.
    We recommend that users unmerge CSTeX:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --unmerge app-text/cstetex</code>
    <p>
    As an alternative, users should upgrade their systems to use teTeX or
    TeX Live with its Babel packages.
    </p>
