    The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
    open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems. The goal of this
    project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that
    provides services in tune with the current HTTP standards.

  <description>
    <p>
    A bug in the proxy_util.c file may lead to a remote buffer overflow. To
    trigger the vulnerability an attacker would have to get mod_proxy to
    connect to a malicous server which returns an invalid (negative)
    Content-Length.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    An attacker could cause a Denial of Service as the Apache child handling
    the request, which will die and under some circumstances execute arbitrary
    code as the user running Apache, usually &quot;apache&quot;.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
    upgrade to the latest available version:

  </workaround>
  <resolution>

    Apache 1.x users should upgrade to the latest version of Apache:
