    <p>
    Gallery is a web application written in PHP which is used to
    organize and publish photo albums. It allows multiple users to build
    and maintain their own albums. It also supports the mirroring of images
    on other servers.

  <description>
    <p>
    Peter Schumacher discovered that Gallery fails to sanitize the
    fullname set by users, possibly leading to a cross-site scripting
    vulnerability.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="low">
    <p>
    By setting a specially crafted fullname, an attacker can inject
    and execute script code in the victim's browser window and potentially
    compromise the user's gallery.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Gallery users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=www-apps/gallery-1.5.2"</code>
    <p>
    Note: Users with the vhosts USE flag set should manually use
    webapp-config to finalize the update.
    </p>
