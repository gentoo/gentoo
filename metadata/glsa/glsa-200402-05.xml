    <p>
    phpMyAdmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the administration
    of MySQL databased over the Web.

  <description>
    <p>
    One component of the phpMyAdmin software package (export.php) does not
    properly verify input that is passed to it from a remote user.  Since the
    input is used to include other files, it is possible to launch a directory
    traversal attack.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    Private information could be gleaned from the remote server if an attacker
    uses a malformed URL such as http://phpmyadmin.example.com/export.php?what=../../../[existing_file] 
    </p>
    <p>
    In this scenario, the script does not sanitize the "what" argument passed
    to it, allowing directory traversal attacks to take place, disclosing
    the contents of files if the file is readable as the web-server user.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    The workaround is to either patch the export.php file using the 
    referenced CVS patch or upgrade the software via Portage.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    Users are encouraged to upgrade to phpMyAdmin-2.5.6_rc1:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    # emerge -pv "&gt;=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.5.6_rc1"
    # emerge "&gt;=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.5.6_rc1"
    # emerge clean</code>
