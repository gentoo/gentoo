  <title>XFree86, X.org: XDM ignores requestPort setting</title>
  <synopsis>
    XDM will open TCP sockets for its chooser, even if the
    DisplayManager.requestPort setting is set to 0. This may allow authorized
    users to access a machine remotely via X, even if the administrator has
    configured XDM to refuse such connections.

    <p>
    The X Display Manager (XDM) is a program which provides a graphical login
    prompt to users on the console or on remote X terminals. It has largely
    been superseded by programs such as GDM and KDM.
    </p>
  </background>
  <description>
    <p>
    XDM will open TCP sockets for its chooser, even if the
    DisplayManager.requestPort setting is set to 0. Remote clients can use this
    port to connect to XDM and request a login window, thus allowing access to
    the system.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="low">
    <p>
    Authorized users may be able to login remotely to a machine running XDM,
    even if this option is disabled in XDM's configuration. Please note that an
    attacker must have a preexisting account on the machine in order to exploit
    this vulnerability.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All users should upgrade to the
    latest available version of X.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    If you are using XFree86, you should run the following:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=x11-base/xfree-4.3.0-r6"
    # emerge ">=x11-base/xfree-4.3.0-r6"</code>
    <p>
    If you are using X.org's X11 server, you should run the following:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=x11-base/xorg-x11-6.7.0-r1"
    # emerge ">=x11-base/xorg-x11-6.7.0-r1"</code>
