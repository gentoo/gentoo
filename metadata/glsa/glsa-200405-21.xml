    <p>
    Numerous security issues have been discovered in Midnight Commander,
    including several buffer overflow vulnerabilities, multiple vulnerabilities
    in the handling of temporary file and directory creation, and multiple
    format string vulnerabilities.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    The buffer overflows and format string vulnerabilities may allow attackers
    to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with permissions of
    the user running MC. The insecure creation of temporary files and
    directories could lead to a privilege escalation, including root
    privileges, for a local attacker.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All users are advised to upgrade
    to version 4.6.0-r7 or higher of Midnight Commander.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Midnight Commander users should upgrade to the latest stable version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=app-misc/mc-4.6.0-r7
    # emerge ">=app-misc/mc-4.6.0-r7"</code>
