    <p>
    Will Drewry (Google Security) reported a vulnerability in the regular
    expression engine when using back references to capture \0 characters
    (CVE-2007-4770). He also found that the backtracking stack size is not
    limited, possibly allowing for a heap-based buffer overflow
    (CVE-2007-4771).
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could submit specially crafted regular expressions to
    an application using the library, possibly resulting in the remote
    execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
    application or a Denial of Service.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All International Components for Unicode users should upgrade to the
    latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=dev-libs/icu-3.8.1-r1"</code>
  </resolution>
