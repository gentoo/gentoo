    <p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in GNUstep Base library.
      Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>A context-dependent attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code. A
      local attacker could possibly read arbitrary files.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All GNUstep Base library users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
      "&gt;=gnustep-base/gnustep-base-1.20.1"
    </code>
    
    <p>Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
      such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these packages.
    </p>
    
    <p>NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
      available since August 13, 2010. It is likely that your system is already
      no longer affected by this issue.
