    <p>
    multi-gnome-terminal contains debugging code that has been known to output
    active keystrokes to a potentially unsafe location. Output has been seen to
    show up in the '.xsession-errors' file in the users home directory. Since
    this file is world-readable on many machines, this bug has the potential to
    leak sensitive information to anyone using the system.
    </p>

  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    Any authorized user on the local machine has the ability to read any
    critical data that has been entered into the terminal, including passwords.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All multi-gnome-terminal users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv "&gt;=x11-terms/multi-gnome-terminal-1.6.2-r1"
    # emerge "&gt;=x11-terms/multi-gnome-terminal-1.6.2-r1"</code>
