    <p>
    The K Desktop Environment (KDE) is a powerful Free Software graphical
    desktop environment. KDE makes use of URI handlers to trigger various
    programs when specific URLs are received.
    </p>

  <description>
    <p>
    The telnet, rlogin, ssh and mailto URI handlers in KDE do not check for '-'
    at the beginning of the hostname passed. By crafting a malicious URI and
    entice an user to click on it, it is possible to pass an option to the
    programs started by the handlers (typically telnet, kmail...).
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    If the attacker controls the options passed to the URI handling programs,
    it becomes possible for example to overwrite arbitrary files (possibly
    leading to denial of service), to open kmail on an attacker-controlled
    remote display or with an alternate configuration file (possibly leading to
    control of the user account).
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All users are advised to upgrade
    to a corrected version of kdelibs.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    Users of KDE 3.1 should upgrade to the corrected version of kdelibs:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv "=kde-base/kdelibs-3.1.5-r1"
    # emerge "=kde-base/kdelibs-3.1.5-r1"</code>
    <p>
    Users of KDE 3.2 should upgrade to the latest available version of kdelibs:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=kde-base/kdelibs-3.2.2-r1"
    # emerge ">=kde-base/kdelibs-3.2.2-r1"</code>
  </resolution>
