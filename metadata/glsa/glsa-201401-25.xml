    <p>ldns is a fast DNS library with the goal to simplify DNS programming and
      to allow developers to easily create software conforming to current RFCs
      and Internet drafts.

  <description>
    <p>ldns contains a heap-based buffer overflow in the
      ldns_rr_new_frm_str_internal function.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of
      Service condition with a crafted Resource Record.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All ldns users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=net-libs/ldns-1.6.11"
    </code>
    
    <p>Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
      such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying these packages.
    </p>
    
    <p>NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
      available since October 11, 2011. It is likely that your system is
      already no longer affected by this issue.
