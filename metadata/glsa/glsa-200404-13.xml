    <p>
    CVS, which stands for Concurrent Versions System, is a client/server
    application which tracks changes to sets of files. It allows multiple
    users to work concurrently on files, and then merge their changes back
    into the main tree (which can be on a remote system). It also allows
    branching, or maintaining separate versions for files.

    <p>
    There are two vulnerabilities in CVS; one in the server and one in the
    client. The server vulnerability allows a malicious client to request
    the contents of any RCS file to which the server has permission, even
    those not located under $CVSROOT. The client vulnerability allows a
    malicious server to overwrite files on the client machine anywhere the
    client has permissions.

  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    Arbitrary files may be read or written on CVS clients and servers by
    anybody with access to the CVS tree.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
    upgrade to the latest stable version of CVS.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All CVS users should upgrade to the latest stable version.
