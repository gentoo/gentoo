  <resolution>
    <p>Gentoo Security support has been discontinued due to phpBB being dropped
      to unstable. As such, we recommend that users unmerge phpBB:
    </p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --unmerge "www-apps/phpBB"
    </code>
    
    <p>NOTE: Users could alternatively upgrade to
      “&gt;=www-apps/phpBB-3.1.10”, however, these packages are not
      currently marked stable.
    </p>
