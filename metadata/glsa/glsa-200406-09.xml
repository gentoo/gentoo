  <description>
    <p>
    A vulnerability in the diff viewer of Chora allows an attacker to inject
    shellcode. An attacker can exploit PHP's file upload functionality to
    upload a malicious binary to a vulnerable server, chmod it as executable,
    and run the file.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    An attacker could remotely execute arbitrary binaries with the permissions
    of the PHP script, conceivably allowing further exploitation of local
    vulnerabilities and remote root access.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All users are advised to upgrade to the latest version of Chora:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=www-apps/horde-chora-1.2.2"
    # emerge ">=www-apps/horde-chora-1.2.2"</code>
