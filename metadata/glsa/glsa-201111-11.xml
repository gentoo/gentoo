  <affected>
    <package name="app-arch/tar" auto="yes" arch="*">

  <background>
    <p>GNU Tar is a utility to create archives as well as add and extract files
      from archives.
    </p>
  </background>
  <description>
    <p>GNU Tar is vulnerable to a boundary error in the rmt_read__ function in
      lib/rtapelib.c, which could cause a heap-based buffer overflow. 
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>A remote attacker could entice the user to load a specially crafted
      archive, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code or a
      Denial of Service.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All GNU Tar users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=app-arch/tar-1.23"
    </code>
    
    <p>NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
      available since July 18, 2010. It is likely that your system is already
      no longer affected by this issue.
