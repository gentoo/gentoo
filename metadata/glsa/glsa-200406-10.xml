    <p>
    Gallery is a web application written in PHP which is used to organize
    and publish photo albums. It allows multiple users to build and
    maintain their own albums. It also supports the mirroring of images on
    other servers.

    <p>
    There is a vulnerability in the Gallery photo album software which may
    allow an attacker to gain administrator privileges within Gallery. A
    Gallery administrator has full access to all albums and photos on the
    server, thus attackers may add or delete photos at will.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    Attackers may gain full access to all Gallery albums. There is no risk
    to the webserver itself, or the server on which it runs.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
    upgrade to the latest available version.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All users should upgrade to the latest available version of Gallery.
