  <title>Squid: Multiple vulnerabilities</title>
  <synopsis>
    Squid contains vulnerabilities in the the code handling NTLM (NT Lan
    Manager), Gopher to HTML, ACLs and WCCP (Web Cache Communication Protocol)
    which could lead to ACL bypass, denial of service and arbitrary code
    execution.

    <p>
    Squid is a full-featured Web proxy cache designed to run on Unix
    systems. It supports proxying and caching of HTTP, FTP, and other URLs,
    as well as SSL support, cache hierarchies, transparent caching, access
    control lists and many other features.

  <description>
    <p>
    Squid contains a vulnerability in the gopherToHTML function
    (CAN-2005-0094) and incorrectly checks the 'number of caches' field
    when parsing WCCP_I_SEE_YOU messages (CAN-2005-0095). Furthermore the
    NTLM code contains two errors. One is a memory leak in the
    fakeauth_auth helper (CAN-2005-0096) and the other is a NULL pointer
    dereferencing error (CAN-2005-0097). Finally Squid also contains an
    error in the ACL parsing code (CAN-2005-0194).
    </p>

  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    With the WCCP issue an attacker could cause denial of service by
    sending a specially crafted UDP packet. With the Gopher issue an
    attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code by enticing a user to
    connect to a malicious Gopher server. The NTLM issues could lead to
    denial of service by memory consumption or by crashing Squid. The ACL
    issue could lead to ACL bypass.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Squid users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose &quot;&gt;=net-proxy/squid-2.5.7-r2&quot;</code>
  </resolution>
