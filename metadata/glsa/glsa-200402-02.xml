    XFree86, provides a client/server interface between display
    hardware and the desktop environment while also providing both the
    windowing infrastructure and a standardized API. XFree86 is
    platform independent, network-transparent and extensible.

    <p>
    Exploitation of a buffer overflow in The XFree86 Window System
    discovered by iDefence allows local attackers to gain root
    privileges.
    </p>
    <p>
    The problem exists in the parsing of the 'font.alias' file. The X
    server (running as root) fails to check the length of the user
    provided input, so a malicious user may craft a malformed
    'font.alias' file causing a buffer overflow upon parsing,
    eventually leading to the execution of arbitrary code.
    </p>
    <p>
    To reproduce the overflow on the command line one can run:
    </p>
    <code>
    # cat > fonts.dir &lt;&lt;EOF 
    1
    word.bdf -misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed--13-120-75-75-c-60-iso8859-1
    EOF
    # perl -e 'print "0" x 1024 . "A" x 96 . "\n"' > fonts.alias
    # X :0 -fp $PWD</code>
    <p>
    {Some output removed}... Server aborting... Segmentation fault (core dumped)
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    Successful exploitation can lead to a root compromise provided
    that the attacker is able to execute commands in the X11
    subsystem. This can be done either by having console access to the
    target or through a remote exploit against any X client program
    such as a web-browser, mail-reader or game.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    No immediate workaround is available; a software upgrade is required.
    </p>
    <p>
    Gentoo has released XFree 4.2.1-r3, 4.3.0-r4 and 4.3.99.902-r1 and
    encourages all users to upgrade their XFree86
    installations. Vulnerable versions are no longer available in
    Portage.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All users are recommended to upgrade their XFree86 installation:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    # emerge -pv x11-base/xfree
    # emerge x11-base/xfree</code>
  </resolution>
