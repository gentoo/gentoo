    Bacula is a network based backup suite.

  <description>
    <p>
    Matthijs Kooijman reported that the "make_catalog_backup" script uses
    the MySQL password as a command line argument when invoking other
    programs.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    A local attacker could list the processes on the local machine when the
    script is running to obtain the MySQL password. Note: The password
    could also be disclosed via network sniffing attacks when the script
    fails, in which case it would be sent via cleartext e-mail.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    A warning about this issue has been added in version 2.4.1, but the
    issue is still unfixed. We advise not to use the make_catalog_backup
    script, but to put all MySQL parameters into a dedicated file readable
    only by the user running Bacula.
