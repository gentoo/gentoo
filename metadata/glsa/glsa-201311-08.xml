  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted XMP
      file using Netpbm, possibly resulting in  execution of arbitrary code
      with the privileges of the process, or a Denial of Service condition.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All Netpbm users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=media-libs/netpbm-10.49.00"
    </code>
    
    <p>Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
      such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these packages.
