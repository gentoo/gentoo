    system compromise.

    <p>
    The Opera browser can cause a buffer allocated on the heap to overflow under
    certain HREFs when rendering HTML.  The mail system is also deemed
    vulnerable and an attacker can send an email containing a malformed HREF, or
    plant the malicious HREF on a web site.

  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    Certain HREFs can cause a buffer allocated on the heap to overflow when
    rendering HTML which can allow arbitrary bytes on the heap to be overwritten
    which can result in a system compromise.

    There is no known workaround at this time.

  <resolution>
    <p>
    Users are encouraged to perform an 'emerge sync' and upgrade the package
    to the latest available version.  Opera 7.22 is recommended as Opera 7.21 is
    vulnerable to other security flaws. Specific steps to upgrade:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    # emerge -pv '&gt;=www-client/opera-7.22'
    # emerge '&gt;=www-client/opera-7.22'
    # emerge clean</code>
