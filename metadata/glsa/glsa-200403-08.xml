    "oftpd is designed to be as secure as an anonymous FTP server can
    possibly be. It runs as non-root for most of the time, and uses the
    Unix chroot() command to hide most of the systems directories from
    external users - they cannot change into them even if the server is
    totally compromised! It contains its own directory change code, so that
    it can run efficiently as a threaded server, and its own directory
    listing code (most FTP servers execute the system "ls" command to list
    files)."

    <p>
    Issuing a port command with a number higher than 255 causes the server
    to crash. The port command may be issued before any authentication
    takes place, meaning the attacker does not need to know a valid
    username and password in order to exploit this vulnerability.
