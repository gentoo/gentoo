  <background>
    <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system
      designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
      speed and efficiency.
    </p>
  </background>
  <description>
    <p>Git is vulnerable to the remote execution of arbitrary code by cloning
      repositories with large filenames or a large number of nested trees. 
      Additionally, some protocols within Git, such as git-remote-ext, can
      execute arbitrary code found within URLs. These URLs that submodules use
      may come from arbitrary sources (e.g., .gitmodules files in a remote
      repository), and can effect those who enable recursive fetch. Restrict
      the allowed protocols to well known and safe ones.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>Remote attackers could execute arbitrary code on both client and server.</p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All Git users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=dev-vcs/git-2.7.3-r1"
    </code>
