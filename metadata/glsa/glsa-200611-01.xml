    character handling.

  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    The vulnerability can be exploited by writing a special string of
    characters to a Screen window. A remote attacker could cause a Denial
    of Service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
    the user running Screen through a program being run inside a Screen
    session, such as an IRC client or a mail client.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Screen users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=app-misc/screen-4.0.3"</code>
  </resolution>
