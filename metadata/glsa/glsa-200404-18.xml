  <title>Multiple Vulnerabilities in ssmtp</title>
  <synopsis>
    There are multiple format string vulnerabilities in the SSMTP package,
    which may allow an attacker to run arbitrary code with ssmtp's privileges
    (potentially root).

  <background>
    <p>
    SSMTP is a very simple mail transfer agent (MTA) that relays mail from the
    local machine to another SMTP host. It is not designed to function as a
    full mail server; its sole purpose is to relay mail.
    </p>

  <description>
    <p>
    There are two format string vulnerabilities inside the log_event() and
    die() functions of ssmtp. Strings from outside ssmtp are passed to various
    printf()-like functions from within log_event() and die() as format
    strings. An attacker could cause a specially-crafted string to be passed to
    these functions, and potentially cause ssmtp to execute arbitrary code.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    If ssmtp connects to a malicious mail relay server, this vulnerability can
    be used to execute code with the rights of the mail sender, including root.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All users are advised to upgrade
    to the latest available version of ssmtp.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All users are advised to upgrade to the latest available version of ssmtp.
