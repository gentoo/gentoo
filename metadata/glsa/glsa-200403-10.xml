    <p>
    Fetchmail versions 6.2.4 and earlier can be crashed by sending a
    specially-crafted email to a fetchmail user. This problem occurs because
    Fetchmail does not properly allocate memory for long lines in an incoming
    email.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    Fetchmail users who receive a malicious email may have their fetchmail
    program crash.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    While a workaround is not currently known for this issue, all users are advised to upgrade to the latest version of fetchmail.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    Fetchmail users should upgrade to version 6.2.5 or later:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    # emerge -pv ">=net-mail/fetchmail-6.2.5"
    # emerge ">=net-mail/fetchmail-6.2.5"</code>
