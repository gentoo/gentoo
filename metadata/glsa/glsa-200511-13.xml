    <p>
    Sylpheed is a lightweight email client and newsreader.
    Sylpheed-Claws is a 'bleeding edge' version of Sylpheed. They both
    support the import of address books in LDIF (Lightweight Directory
    Interchange Format).

  <description>
    <p>
    Colin Leroy reported buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Sylpheed
    and Sylpheed-Claws. The LDIF importer uses a fixed length buffer to
    store data of variable length. Two similar problems exist also in the
    Mutt and Pine addressbook importers of Sylpheed-Claws.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    By convincing a user to import a specially-crafted LDIF file into
    the address book, a remote attacker could cause the program to crash,
    potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code with the
    privileges of the user running the software.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Sylpheed users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose &quot;&gt;=mail-client/sylpheed-2.0.4&quot;</code>
    <p>
