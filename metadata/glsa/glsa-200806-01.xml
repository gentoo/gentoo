    Adam Zabrocki reported a boundary error within the split_redraw()
    function in the file split.c, possibly leading to a stack-based buffer
    overflow.

  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could use a specially crafted resolved hostname to
    execute arbitrary code with root privileges. However, it is required
    that the attacker controls the DNS server used by the victim, and that
    the "-p" (or "--split") command line option is used.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All mtr users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose &quot;&gt;=net-analyzer/mtr-0.73-r1&quot;</code>
  </resolution>
