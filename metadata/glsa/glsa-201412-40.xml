    <p>The Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) library is the reference
      implementation of the FLAC audio file format.

  <description>
    <p>A stack-based buffer overflow flaw has been discovered in FLAC.</p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted .flac
      file using an application linked against FLAC, possibly resulting in
      execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or a
      Denial of Service condition.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>There is no known workaround at this time.</p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>All FLAC users should upgrade to the latest version:</p>
    
    <code>
      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=media-libs/flac-1.3.1-r1"
    </code>
    
    <p>Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
      such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying these packages.
