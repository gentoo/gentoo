    client.  It is compatible with AIM , ICQ, MSN Messenger, Yahoo,
    IRC, Jabber, Gadu-Gadu, and the Zephyr networks.

    <p>
    Yahoo changed the authentication methods to their IM servers,
    rendering GAIM useless. The GAIM team released a rushed release
    solving this issue, however, at the same time a code audit
    revealed 12 new vulnerabilities.
    </p>

  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    Due to the nature of instant messaging many of these bugs require
    man-in-the-middle attacks between the client and the server. But
    the underlying protocols are easy to implement and attacking
    ordinary TCP sessions is a fairly simple task. As a result, all
    users are advised to upgrade their GAIM installation.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Users of GAIM 0.74 or below are affected by 7 of the
        vulnerabilities and are encouraged to upgrade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Users of GAIM 0.75 are affected by 11 of the vulnerabilities
        and are encouraged to upgrade to the patched version of GAIM
        offered by Gentoo.
      </li>
      <li>
        Users of GAIM 0.75-r6 are only affected by
        4 of the vulnerabilities, but are still urged to upgrade to
        maintain security.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no immediate workaround; a software upgrade is required.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All users are recommended to upgrade GAIM to 0.75-r7.
