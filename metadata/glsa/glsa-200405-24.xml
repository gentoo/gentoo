    <p>
    MPlayer is a movie player capable of handling multiple multimedia file
    formats. xine-lib is a multimedia player library used by several graphical
    user interfaces, including xine-ui. They both use the same code to handle
    Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) streams from RealNetworks servers.
    </p>

  <description>
    <p>
    Multiple vulnerabilities have been found and fixed in the RTSP handling
    code common to recent versions of these two packages. These vulnerabilities
    include several remotely exploitable buffer overflows.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    A remote attacker, posing as a RTSP stream server, can execute arbitrary
    code with the rights of the user of the software playing the stream
    (MPlayer or any player using xine-lib). Another attacker may entice a user
    to use a maliciously crafted URL or playlist to achieve the same results.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    For MPlayer, there is no known workaround at this time. For xine-lib, you
    can delete the xineplug_inp_rtsp.so file.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All users should upgrade to non-vulnerable versions of MPlayer and
    xine-lib:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0_pre4"
    # emerge ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0_pre4"

    # emerge -pv ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1_rc4"
    # emerge ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1_rc4"</code>
  </resolution>
