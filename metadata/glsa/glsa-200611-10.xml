  <background>
    <p>
    WordPress is a PHP and MySQL based multiuser blogging system.

    <p>
    "random" discovered that users can enter serialized objects as strings
    in their profiles that will be harmful when unserialized. "adapter"
    found out that user-edit.php fails to effectively deny non-permitted
    users access to other user's metadata. Additionally, a directory
    traversal vulnerability in the wp-db-backup module was discovered.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    By entering specially crafted strings in his profile, an attacker can
    crash PHP or even the web server running WordPress. Additionally, by
    crafting a simple URL, an attacker can read metadata of any other user,
    regardless of their own permissions. A user with the permission to use
    the database backup plugin can possibly overwrite files he otherwise
    has no access to.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All WordPress users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=www-apps/wordpress-2.0.5"</code>
  </resolution>
