    <p>
    Erik Sjolund discovered a buffer overflow in fliccd which is part
    of the INDI support in KStars.

  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute code with
    elevated privileges. If fliccd does not run as daemon remote
    exploitation of this vulnerability is not possible. KDE as shipped by
    Gentoo does not start the daemon in the default installation.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All KStars users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose &quot;&gt;=kde-base/kdeedu-3.3.2-r1&quot;</code>
  </resolution>
