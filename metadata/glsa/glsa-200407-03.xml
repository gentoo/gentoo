  <title>Apache 2: Remote denial of service attack</title>
  <synopsis>
    A bug in Apache may allow a remote attacker to perform a Denial of Service
    attack. With certain configurations this could lead to a heap based buffer
    overflow.

    The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
    open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems. The goal of this
    project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that
    provides services in tune with the current HTTP standards.

    A bug in the protocol.c file handling header lines will cause Apache to
    allocate memory for header lines starting with TAB or SPACE.

  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform a Denial of Service
    attack by causing Apache to exhaust all memory. On 64 bit systems with more
    than 4GB of virtual memory a possible integer signedness error could lead
    to a buffer based overflow causing Apache to crash and under some
    circumstances execute arbitrary code as the user running Apache, usually
    "apache".

  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
    upgrade to the latest available version:

  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    Apache 2 users should upgrade to the latest version of Apache:
