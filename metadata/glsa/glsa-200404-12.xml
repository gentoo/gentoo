    <p>
    Scorched 3D is a game based loosely on the classic DOS game &quot;Scorched
    Earth&quot;. Scorched 3D adds amongst other new features a 3D island
    environment and LAN and internet play. Scorched 3D is totally free and is
    available for multiple operating systems.

    <p>
    Scorched 3D (build 36.2 and before) does not properly check the text
    entered in the Chat box (T key). Using format string characters, you can
    generate a heap overflow. This and several other unchecked buffers have
    been corrected in the build 37 release.
    </p>

  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    This vulnerability can be easily exploited to remotely crash the Scorched
    3D server, disconnecting all clients. It could also theorically be used to
    execute arbitrary code on the server with the rights of the user running
    the server.
