    monitoring of processes, files, directories and devices on a Unix system.

  <description>
    <p>
    Monit has several vulnerabilities in its HTTP interface : a buffer overflow
    vulnerability in the authentication handling code and a off-by-one error in
    the POST method handling code.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    An attacker may exploit the off-by-one error to crash the Monit daemon and
    create a denial of service condition, or cause a buffer overflow that would
    allow arbitrary code to be executed with root privileges.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    A workaround is not currently known for this issue. All users are advised
    to upgrade to the latest version of the affected package.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    Monit users should upgrade to version 4.2.1 or later:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync

    # emerge -pv "&gt;=app-admin/monit-4.2.1"
    # emerge "&gt;=app-admin/monit-4.2.1"</code>
  </resolution>
