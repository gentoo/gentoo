    Colin Percival from FreeBSD reported that the previous fix for the
    file_printf() buffer overflow introduced a new integer overflow.

  <impact type="high">
    <p>
    A remote attacker could entice a user to run the file program on an
    overly large file (more than 1Gb) that would trigger an integer
    overflow on 32-bit systems, possibly leading to the execution of
    arbitrary code with the rights of the user running file.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    Since file is a system package, all Gentoo users should upgrade to the
    latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose &quot;&gt;=sys-apps/file-4.21&quot;</code>
  </resolution>
