  <description>
    <p>
    A vulnerability has been discovered by Andi Kleen in the ptrace emulation
    code for AMD64 platforms when eflags are processed, allowing a local user
    to obtain elevated priveleges.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
    project, http://cve.mitre.org, has assigned CAN-2004-0001 to this issue.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    Only users of the AMD64 platform are affected: in this scenario, a user may
    be able to obtain elevated priveleges, including root access. However, no
    public exploit is known for the vulnerability at this time.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no temporary workaround - a kernel upgrade is required. A list of
    unaffected kernels is provided along with this announcement.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest available sources for
    their system:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    # emerge -pv your-favourite-sources
    # emerge your-favourite-sources
    # # Follow usual procedure for compiling and installing a kernel.
    # # If you use genkernel, run genkernel as you would do normally.
    </code>
    <code>
    # # IF YOUR KERNEL IS MARKED as "remerge required!" THEN
    # # YOU SHOULD UPDATE YOUR KERNEL EVEN IF PORTAGE
    # # REPORTS THAT THE SAME VERSION IS INSTALLED.
    </code>
