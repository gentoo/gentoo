    <p>
    Sendmail is a popular mail transfer agent (MTA).

  <description>
    <p>
    Frank Sheiness discovered that the mime8to7() function can recurse
    endlessly during the decoding of multipart MIME messages until the
    stack of the process is filled and the process crashes.

  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    By sending specially crafted multipart MIME messages, a remote
    attacker can cause a subprocess forked by Sendmail to crash. If
    Sendmail is not set to use a randomized queue processing, the attack
    will effectively halt the delivery of queued mails as well as the
    malformed one, incoming mail delivered interactively is not affected.
    Additionally, on systems where core dumps with an individual naming
    scheme (like "core.pid") are enabled, a filesystem may fill up with
    core dumps. Core dumps are disabled by default in Gentoo.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    The Sendmail 8.13.7 release information offers some workarounds, please
    see the Reference below. Note that the issue has actually been fixed in
    the 8.13.6-r1 ebuild.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All Sendmail users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose &quot;&gt;=mail-mta/sendmail-8.13.6-r1&quot;</code>
