The Gentoo Kernel Team will no longer be providing stable
vanilla-sources kernels. All currently stabilized vanilla-sources
versions will be dropped to ~arch. The Arch teams, via normal requests
of the Kernel Team, will continue to stabilize gentoo-sources kernels
upon request. This decision is based on the facts that upstream is now
releasing approximately 1-2 vanilla-sources kernels a week. Arch teams,
understandably, are unable to keep up with this rate of release.  As
most vanilla releases contain security fixes, the user who only runs
stable vanilla-sources will consistently be behind and potentially at
risk.  For the latest "upstream kernel unpatched by Gentoo", we
recommend users add 'sys-kernel/vanilla-sources' to their
package.accept_keywords file. gentoo-sources will continue to be a
tested and supported version for Gentoo users.


Note: This news item only applies to gentoo-sources and vanilla-sources.
Other kernels currently maintained in portage have their own policies
and procedures in place today.
