This news item is relevant to you only if you have a Radeon graphics
chipset and use the free/open source driver.

The r600 driver that provides 3D acceleration for Radeon HD 2400 and
later cards comes in the "classic" and "gallium" variants. The gallium
driver is based on the new Gallium3D infrastructure and was chosen as
the default driver for media-libs/mesa-7.11.

Existing users will not be switched automatically. To switch to the
r600 gallium driver, use the following command:

    eselect mesa set r600 gallium

Gallium3D requires kernel modesetting (KMS). If your system is not yet
configured for KMS, consult the X Server Configuration HOWTO for
instructions prior to switching:
