In dhcpcd-6.10.0, the following hooks are no longer installed in
/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks by default:

10-wpa_supplicant
15-timezone
29-lookup-hostname

These are now installed in /usr/share/dhcpcd/hooks, which is an example
directory.

If you were using these hooks before you upgrade to 6.10.0, you will
need to copy them back to the /lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks directory after the
upgrade.
