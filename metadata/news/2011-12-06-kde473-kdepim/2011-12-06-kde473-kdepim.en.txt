We are pleased to announce the upcoming stabilization of KDE 4.7.3. 
In general the upgrade of KDE from 4.6.5 to 4.7.3 should be unproblematic.
However, if you are using the KDEPIM application suite (i.e., akregator,
blogilo, kmail, knode, kontact, korganizer, and others) where the stable
version so far was 4.4.11.1, please be aware of the following:

The stable upgrade from KDEPIM 4.4.11.1 to KDEPIM 4.7.3 is a MAJOR upgrade 
with potential for major breakage. Therefore we will *try* to keep 
and support the old, so-far stable KDEPIM 4.4.11.1 as long as possible. 
If you *dont* want to upgrade your KDEPIM yet but keep the old version, 
please download the following file and add it into your 
/etc/portage/package.mask:

If you decide to upgrade, please have a look at the upgrade guide first:
