net-print/cups-1.6 no longer supports automatic remote printers or
implicit classes via the CUPS, LDAP, or SLP protocols, i.e. "network
browsing".

The browsing functionality can be restored by running cups-browsed
from net-print/cups-filters as a separate daemon (just add its init
script to your default runlevel). By default cups-browsed uses the
net-print/cups-1.5 browse protocol, but it can also utilize zeroconf
(if the zeroconf use flag is set). See /etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf
for configuration.

Of course, directly specifying the location of your printers in
the cups interface works as well.
