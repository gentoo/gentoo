The multislot use flag in sys-boot/grub-2.x is no longer enabled by
default.

When the flag is enabled, all upstream binaries and documentation are
renamed to "grub2" so as not to collide with grub-0.  Now that the use
flag is no longer default-enabled, these names will revert back to
their upstream defaults.  For example, grub2-mkconfig will become
grub-mkconfig, grub2-install will become grub-install, etc.

If you wish to retain the previous naming scheme, please make sure to
explicitly enable USE="multislot" on sys-boot/grub in the usual manner.
