libjpeg-turbo is a derivative of libjpeg that uses MMX, SSE, SSE2,
and NEON SIMD instructions to accelerate baseline JPEG
compression/decompression by about 2-4x on amd64, arm and x86
platforms. It is based on libjpeg/SIMD but has numerous enhancements.

All users are recommended to migrate:

# emerge --deselect media-libs/jpeg
# emerge --oneshot media-libs/libjpeg-turbo

media-libs/jpeg:0 will be left in tree as a fallback implementation.
