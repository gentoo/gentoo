The behaviour of localmount and netmount is changing on Linux systems.
In the past, these services always started successfully. However, now they
will fail if a file system they attempt to mount cannot be mounted.

If you have file systems listed in fstab which should not be mounted at
boot time, make sure to add noauto to the mount options. If you have
file systems that you want to attempt to mount at boot time but failure
should be allowed, add nofail to the mount options for these file
systems in fstab.
