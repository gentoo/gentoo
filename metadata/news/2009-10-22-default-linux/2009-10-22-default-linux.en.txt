The profiles in default-linux/ have been deprecated for six weeks.
Users using these profiles are expected to migrate to a new profile
before 2009-12-01, at which point the default-linux/ profiles will be
removed.  The new profiles contain up to date configurations and were
adopted because they were easier to maintain.  Users can switch to a
new profile using eselect:

# eselect profile list
# eselect profile set <target>

If a machine is not migrated to a new valid profile before the deprecated 
profiles are removed, emerge will have very limited functionality until 
the migration is done.
