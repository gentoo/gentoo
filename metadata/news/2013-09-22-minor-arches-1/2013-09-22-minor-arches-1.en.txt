Following discussion [1] and a vote by the Gentoo Council [2,3], 
m68k, s390, and sh will drop all stable keywords and become 
unstable/testing only arches. The main reason for this is that 
these arch teams visibly lack manpower, resulting in undesirable
delays.

In a week, the ACCEPT_KEYWORDS variable in the respective profiles
will be switched to automatically include ~arch packages. Systems
running stable before will update to current unstable/testing then.
Afterwards m68k, s390, and sh keywords on all ebuilds will be
changed to ~m68k, ~s390, and ~sh.

No steps are required from users, however you should be aware
of the upcoming changes.
