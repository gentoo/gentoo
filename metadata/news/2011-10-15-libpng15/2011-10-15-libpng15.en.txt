After upgrading from libpng14 to libpng15 it's important that you rebuild
cairo and gdk-pixbuf as soon as possible if they are installed.

Then you can proceed with rebuilding the rest of the software against the new
library:

# revdep-rebuild --library libpng14.so.14 -- --keep-going

Note: It might be necessary to run the previous command more than once.

If you find packages not building with the message "ld: cannot find -lpng14",
they are likely caused by broken libtool archives (.la) in your system.

You can identify those files with following one-liner:

# find /usr/ -name '*.la' -exec grep png14 {} +

Once you have identified the broken files, you can either delete them,
edit them in place and replace png14 with png15, or re-emerge the packages
they belong to.
