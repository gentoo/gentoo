With the 2.4 branch released by upstream almost 4 years ago, stable
Gentoo systems will soon be upgraded from apache 2.2 to apache 2.4.
When upgrading, some configuration changes will have to be made.
Upstream has a handy guide:

https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/upgrading.html

For more information on all the new features, start here:

After emerging Apache 2.4, you will also need to rebuild any
third-party modules:

emerge -av1 /usr/lib/apache2/modules --exclude=www-servers/apache
