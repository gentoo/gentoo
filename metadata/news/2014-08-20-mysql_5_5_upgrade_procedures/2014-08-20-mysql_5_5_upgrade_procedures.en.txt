MySQL 5.5 is now stable across all arches. The upgrade process
will require you to rebuild everything linked to
libmysqlclient.so.16 and libmysqlclient_r.so.16.

This may be done for you by portage with 'emerge @preserved-rebuild'.

A small number of libraries may not be automatically rebuilt against
the new MySQL libraries using preserved-rebuild.  If you have
difficulties with packages not finding the new libraries, install
app-portage/gentoolkit and run:
# revdep-rebuild --library libmysqlclient.so.16
# revdep-rebuild --library libmysqlclient_r.so.16

The official upgrade documentation is available here:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/upgrading.html

Please be sure to review the upgrade document for any possible actions
necessary before and after the upgrade. This includes running
mysql_upgrade after the upgrade completion.

Due to security flaws, MySQL 5.1 will be hard masked in 30 days after
this news item is posted.  It will remain masked in the tree for
3 months before removal.
