The method for setting default applications for specific URI types
(https://, mailto://, etc.) changed in dev-libs/glib-2.28 and newer.
If you previously set them in GConf using the Configuration Editor,
they will now be ignored.

If you use GNOME, you must upgrade gnome-session and
gnome-control-center and set your default browser/mail-client again.

If you don't use GNOME, you should ensure that the file
~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list has the following content:

[Added Associations]
x-scheme-handler/http=$browser_name.desktop;
x-scheme-handler/https=$browser_name.desktop;
x-scheme-handler/mailto=$mailclient_name.desktop;

Replace $browser_name.desktop and $mailclient_name.desktop with the
appropriate file from /usr/share/applications that can handle
http/https/mailto URIs.

The system-wide version of the file is often at
/usr/share/applications/defaults.list instead.

Please make sure that your browsers and mail clients have been upgraded
to the latest stable versions before doing all this.
