Many MythTV users use the SchedulesDirect service as a source of program
data.  If you use this service you will need to take action or you will
lose access to scheduling data on Nov 1st 2014.  If you do not use this
service, no action is required.

If you use the SchedulesDirect service, you must either upgrade to
media-tv/mythtv-0.27.4, or you must follow one of the workarounds found
at: http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Schedules_Direct_URL_Change

The link above also provides additional information about the change.
