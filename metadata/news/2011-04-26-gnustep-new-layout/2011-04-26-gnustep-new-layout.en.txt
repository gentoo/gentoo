Traditionally, GNUstep used its own filesystem layout, installing
everything under /usr/GNUstep. Starting with gnustep-make-2.6.0, the
default filesystem layout has changed and is now the 'fhs' layout,
installing files in standard Unix directories.

Following upstream's change, GNUstep packages in Gentoo will now
also use the new default layout. Your system will switch to it
after updating gnustep-base/gnustep-make to >=2.6.0.

This change means that you have to re-emerge all installed packages
depending on GNUstep to move them to the new layout. You can use
gnustep-base/gnustep-updater for this step
