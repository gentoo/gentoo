On 28 Jun 2011, baselayout-2.x and OpenRC were first marked stable on
all supported architectures in Gentoo Linux.

This was the point at which we stopped working on issues in baselayout-1
and began encouraging users to upgrade to baselayout-2 and OpenRC.

Although we are not supporting baselayout-1, we are supporting migration
from baselayout-1 to OpenRC and baselayout-2.

According to Gentoo policy, the support for migration from baselayout-1
to baselayout-2 ends one year after baselayout-2 and OpenRC became
stable. That date will be 28 Jun 2012.

This news item is to inform you that you must migrate your system
to baselayout-2 and OpenRC before 28 Jun 2012. Starting on this date, we
will no longer support this migration, and you may need to re-install
any systems which are still running baselayout-1.

For questions about how to migrate your system, see the OpenRC migration
guide [1].
