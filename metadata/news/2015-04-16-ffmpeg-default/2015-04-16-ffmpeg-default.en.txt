Since the choice between ffmpeg and libav has been made more
explicit, there has been a lot of discussion about what the
default implementation should be. It can be concluded that
media-video/ffmpeg has wider support, and would be somewhat
more convenient for most end-users.

For this reason the default implementation has been switched
back from media-video/libav to media-video/ffmpeg by removing
the libav useflag from the base profile.

If the libav useflag is already globally enabled or disabled
in /etc/portage/make.conf, then no further action is required.

Users who implicitly relied on libav being enabled in their
profile, and who wish to continue using libav, should enable
USE=libav in their /etc/portage/make.conf file.
