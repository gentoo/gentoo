Python 3 is a new major version of Python and is intentionally incompatible
with Python 2. Many external modules have not been ported yet to Python 3,
so Python 2 still needs to be installed. You can benefit from having Python 3
installed without setting Python 3.1 as main active version of Python.
Currently you should not set Python 3.1 as main active version of Python.
When setting it becomes recommended, a separate news item will be created
to notify users.

Although Python 3.1 should not be set as main active version of Python,
you should run python-updater after installation of Python 3.1. By default,
modules that support both Python 2 and Python 3 are installed for both
the active version of Python 2 and the active version of Python 3 when both
Python 2 and Python 3 are installed.

It is recommended to use a UTF-8 locale to avoid potential problems. Especially
C and POSIX locales are discouraged. If locale has not been explicitly set,
then POSIX locale is used, so you should ensure that locale has been set.
Problems occurring only with non-UTF-8 locales should be reported directly
to upstream developers of given packages.
See http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/utf-8.xml for more information about UTF-8.
