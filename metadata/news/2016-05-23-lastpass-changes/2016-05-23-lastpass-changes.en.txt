LastPass-3 and earlier versions installed browser extensions along
with the necessary binary components. LastPass-4 and later versions
install only the binary components and leave installing the browser
extensions to the user. Furthermore, LastPass-3 is not available
anymore, it will be removed soon and users are required to upgrade. A
transparent package move is not possible due to the mentioned changes
and a manual migration is required.

The currently installed package must be removed before proceeding with
the migration:

emerge --unmerge --ask app-admin/lastpass

LastPass for Firefox users can safely upgrade to version 4 by visiting
the official LastPass website and following the download instructions.
The browser extension already contains the required binary components.
No packages need to be installed.

Users of Chrome/Chromium and Opera browsers need to switch to
app-admin/lastpass-binary-component and follow the instructions
displayed on the screen after the installation to complete the process.
