The 5.2.x release series of Bacula uses a new database catalog format.
If you're upgrading from a 3.x.x or 5.0.x release, you must upgrade your
bacula catalog database.

Please read the manual chapter for how to upgrade your database (see
http://www.bacula.org/5.2.x-manuals/en/main/main/Installing_Bacula.html).
You can find database upgrade scripts in /usr/libexec/bacula/(updatedb/).

It is strongly recommended that you save a copy of your existing database
before upgrading. For details how to do it please look into your database
documentation.

The simplest way to upgrade the database:

1. Stop Bacula from running (at least the director and storage daemons).
2. Save a copy of your existing database.
3. Emerge the new version of Bacula.
4. Run the appropriate upgrade script from /usr/libexec/bacula/updatedb/. 
5. Start the new Bacula.
