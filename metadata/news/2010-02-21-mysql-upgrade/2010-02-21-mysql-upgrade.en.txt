The 5.1 series of MySQL is going to be unmasked at the same time as the release
of this news item. When upgrading from an older major version (including 5.0),
you will be required to rebuild everything linked to the libmysqlclient.so.15
and libmysqlclient_r.so.15.

You can do this by installing app-portage/gentoolkit and running:
# revdep-rebuild --library libmysqlclient.so.15
# revdep-rebuild --library libmysqlclient_r.so.15

If you use the Portage 2.2 series, you may also use:
# emerge @preserved-rebuild

The official upgrade documentation is available here:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/upgrading.html

Note that existing databases may need converting as well, again including those
upgrading from 5.0 to 5.1. Details are in the update documentation.
