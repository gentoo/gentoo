Layman has been using /usr/local/portage/layman to store
overlay checkouts from version 1.2.3 on.  As that path
was violating the concept of keeping portage away from
/usr/local the default of this storage location moves to

  /var/lib/layman

from version 1.3.0 on.  If you have never touched the file
/etc/layman/layman.cfg manually before, you may be tempted to let
tools like etc-update or dispatch-conf blindly accept this new version
of layman.cfg.

As that would hide all your currently installed overlays from layman
it's probably not what you want.  Your options are:

 A) Moving
   1. Move your current content to /var/lib/layman.
   2. Update PORTDIR_OVERLAY in /var/lib/layman/make.conf accordingly.
   3. Make /etc/make.conf source /var/lib/layman/make.conf.
   4. Set option "storage" in /etc/layman/layman.cfg
      to "/var/lib/layman".

 B) A symlink
   Put a symlink to your current storage location at /var/lib/layman
   before upgrading layman.

 C) Configuration
   Reject the path change for layman.cfg when running tools like
   etc-update or dispatch-conf.  Be aware with this way you'll have
   to do it for each layman update again.
