The options CONFIG_FHANDLE and CONFIG_NET are now required in the kernel.
You will be warned of them if they are missing while you upgrade to
>=sys-fs/udev-210 by the package manager.
See the package's README at /usr/share/doc/udev-210/ for more optional
kernel options.

The most reliable way of disabling the new network interface scheme is still
the kernel parameter "net.ifnames=0" since overriding the
80-net-name-slot.rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/ no longer works since upstream
renamed the file to /lib/udev/rules.d/80-net-setup-link.rules
The actual configuration is at /lib/systemd/network/99-default.link, which
you can override in /etc/systemd/network/
So, to clarify, you can override the new .rules file or the .link file in /etc
but using the kernel parameter is the most consistent way.

Since both the systemd-udevd executable and the network configuration is stored
at /lib/systemd, using a too wide INSTALL_MASK would be a mistake.
