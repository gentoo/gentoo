Ruby MRI 1.8 has been retired by upstream in June 2013.[1]
We remove Ruby MRI 1.8 support from the tree now. In parallel Ruby MRI 2.0 
support will be activated in base profile's RUBY_TARGETS variable by default 
in conjunction with Ruby MRI 1.9.

If your currently eselected Ruby interpreter is ruby18, our recommendation is 
to change it to ruby19. At the moment Ruby MRI 1.9 delivers the best possible 
support of all Ruby interpreters in tree.

Check the current setting via:

	eselect ruby show

Change the current setting to Ruby MRI 1.9 via:

	eselect ruby set ruby19
