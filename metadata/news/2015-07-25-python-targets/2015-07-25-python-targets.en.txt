Python 3.4 is now enabled by default, replacing Python 3.3 as the
default Python 3 interpreter.

PYTHON_TARGETS will be adjusted to contain python2_7 and python3_4 by
default via your profile.

PYTHON_SINGLE_TARGET will remain set to python2_7 by default.

If you have PYTHON_TARGETS set in make.conf, that setting will still be
respected. You may want to adjust this setting manually.

Once the changes have taken place, a world update should take care of
reinstalling any python libraries you have installed. You should also
switch your default python3 interpreter using eselect python.

For example:

eselect python set --python3 python3.4
emerge -uDv --changed-use @world
