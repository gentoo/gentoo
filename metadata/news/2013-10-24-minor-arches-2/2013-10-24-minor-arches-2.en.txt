Following discussion [1] and a vote by the Gentoo Council [2,3], 
on alpha and ia64 package maintainers are allowed to remove
the last stable version of a package under certain circumstances
(basically when it is outdated and the stablerequest for a newer
version on alpha or ia64 has been pending for a while; for the 
details, see [2,3]).

You should be aware that this may occasionally cause broken
dependencies and/or require keywording of packages for stable 
users. Then again, things may work out fine just as well.
