Since the IA64 arch team does not have the resources to maintain Java support,
we have agreed that ia64 keywords will be dropped from Java packages, and the 
java USE flag masked on IA64, unless more manpower becomes available.
If you are willing to help with the maintenance, please contact ia64@gentoo.org.
If there is not enough interest, Java support will be removed during the second
half of March 2011.

The removal is tracked in bug #345433.
