The baselayout package provides files which all systems must have in
order to function properly. You are currently using version 1.x, which
has several issues. The most significant of these is that the included
init scripts are written entirely in bash, which makes them slow and
not very flexible.

On 2011/05/08, you will see an update for sys-apps/baselayout to
2.x and a new package, sys-apps/openrc. It is recommended that you
perform this update as soon as possible.

Please note, after these packages are emerged, it is
__Absolutely_Critical__ that you immediately update your configuration
files with dispatch-conf, etc-update or a similar tool then follow the
steps in the migration guide located at the following URL.

FAILURE TO FOLLOW ALL OF THESE STEPS WILL RESULT IN AN UNBOOTABLE
SYSTEM! IF THIS SHOULD HAPPEN, YOU WILL NEED TO BOOT FROM A LIVE CD OR
DVD, MOUNT YOUR ROOT FILE SYSTEM, CHROOT INTO THAT ENVIRONMENT AND
FOLLOW THE ABOVE STEPS!
