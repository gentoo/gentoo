The newest release of LLVM 3.9 has undergone major Gentoo changes,
and may require explicit action prior to the upgrade. In this release,
the semi-implicit target choice has been replaced with an explicit
LLVM_TARGETS flag set.

If you did not enable USE=multitarget, no action should be required.
The targets for your host CPU, Berkeley Packet Filter (used by some
packages) and possibly two major GPUs (AMDGPU and NVPTX) will be enabled
by default which is a superset of the previous default. However, you may
want to disable some of those targets if you do not intend to install
packages requiring them (dev-util/bcc, media-libs/mesa).

If you enabled USE=multitarget, you will now need to specify all
the requested targets explicitly. The old flag will be preserved
for some time for compatibility reasons; however, it will only enforce
explicitly selecting all targets.

In order to enable all targets, add the following to your
/etc/portage/package.use or equivalent file:

  sys-devel/llvm LLVM_TARGETS: *
  sys-devel/clang LLVM_TARGETS: *

If you had to use USE=multitarget to enable some of the targets you
needed, you can now disable the flag and specify those targets
explicitly.

Please also note that starting with LLVM-4.0, sys-devel/clang will be
built as a separate package and the enabled LLVM_TARGETS for that
package will actually enforce requested targets.

Setting LLVM_TARGETS globally is discouraged as it can cause bootstrap
issues with sys-libs/compiler-rt in the future.
