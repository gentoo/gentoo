For several years, Gentoo has been patching python3 in a way that is
incompatible with PEP 3149 [1]. Gentoo has been enabling the PyMalloc feature,
but our python packages have not carried the appropriate ABI flag.

We have removed this patch from the most recent dev-lang/python ebuilds at
the time of this writing. One result of this is that any packages which
install python extension modules must be rebuilt.

You should rebuild affected packages using the following command.

emerge -1v $(find /usr/lib*/python3* -name '*cpython-3[3-5].so')

You may experience build failures in related packages until this has been
completed.
