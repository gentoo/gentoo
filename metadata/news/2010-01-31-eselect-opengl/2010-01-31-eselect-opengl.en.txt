Eselect-opengl package now strips the libGL.la file. This file was broken and
thus we proceeded with its removal. It brings slight inconvenience on you fellow
users. After emerging the new version =app-admin/eselect-opengl-1.1.1-r2 please
emerge one more package dev-util/lafilefixer and use it for fixing all various
compilation issues by running as root:
# lafilefixer --justfixit
Note that not-running this command will bring you compilation issues so you
should really pay attention to this message and act upon it.
