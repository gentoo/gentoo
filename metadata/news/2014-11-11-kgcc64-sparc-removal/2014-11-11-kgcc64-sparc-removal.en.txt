sys-devel/kgcc64 is going to be removed from the sparc system package set
since the normal sys-devel/gcc can, since version 4.4, build 64bit kernels.

Until now, you had to use CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE="sparc64-unknown-linux-gnu-"
in your kernel config, but with sys-devel/kgcc64 going away, you need to
remove that option from your kernel configuration.
