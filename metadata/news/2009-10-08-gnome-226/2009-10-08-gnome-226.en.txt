We are pleased to announce the stabilization of GNOME-2.26. Users are
strongly encouraged to read the GNOME 2.26 Upgrade Guide, to avoid any
possible issues relating to the upgrade, such as Applications menu items
disappearing, or nautilus constantly restarting when it is configured to
not handle the desktop.
