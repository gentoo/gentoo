The two functions that are assigned to the formulas structs secnod field
`int (*calculate)(number_t number_t number_t number_t)`
(without the REGISTERS(3) which is just a macro to GCC regparm)

However, clang16 has -Wincompatible-function-pointer-types by default, and it
does not like that and complains, that assigning these functions into the
structs fields is a problem due to incompatible types.
