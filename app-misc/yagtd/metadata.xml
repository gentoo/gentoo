yaGTD incorporates major features from Allen's 'Getting Things Done' philosophy and 
notion of urgency and importance preached by Stephen Covey 
(cf Seven Habits of Highly Effective People book).
To resume, if you are comfortable at the command line a simple plain text is an
age-old but perfect method for tracking your stuff, and yaGTD can help you to
manage efficiently this file.
