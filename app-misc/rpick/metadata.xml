		rpick is a command line tool that helps you to pick items from a list, using
		configurable algorithms.

		An example use case for this is picking a restaurant. You might want to
		generally go to restaurants you haven't visited in a while, but you also
		might not want to use a strict least recently used model and spice
		things up with some element of chance, with restaurants you've least
		recently visited getting a boost in their chances.
