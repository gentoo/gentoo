DigiTemp is a simple to use program for reading values from 1-wire devices. Its
main use is for reading temperature sensors, but it also reads counters, and
understands the 1-wire hubs with devices on different branches of the network.
DigiTemp now supports the following 1-wire temperature sensors: DS18S20 (and
DS1820), DS18B20, DS1822, the DS2438 Smart Battery Monitor, DS2422 and DS2423
Counters, DS2409 MicroLAN Coupler (used in 1-wire hubs), and the AAG TAI-8540
humidity sensor.
