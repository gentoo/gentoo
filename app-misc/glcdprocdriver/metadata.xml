		GLCDprocDriver is the glue between the graphlcd-base library from the GraphLCD project,
		which is written in C++, and LCDproc's meta-driver "glcdlib", which extends supported
		displays in LCDproc by those supported through graphlcd-base (but just in text mode, of course).
		It is implemented in C++, but provides the necessary wrapper C calls for use by glcdlib.
		It is NOT intended to provide general C wrapping for the whole graphlcd-base, library,
		as it really only implements the actual meta-driver for LCDproc.
