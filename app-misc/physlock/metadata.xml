	Control physical access to a linux computer by locking all of its virtual
	terminals / consoles.

	physlock is an alternative to vlock, it is equivalent to `vlock -an'. It is
	written because vlock blocks some linux kernel mechanisms like hibernate and
	suspend and can therefore only be used with some limitations. physlock is
	designed to be more lightweight, it does not have a plugin interface and it is
	not started using a shell script wrapper.
