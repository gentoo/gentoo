		FHEM is a GPL'd perl server for house automation.
		It is used to automate some common tasks in the household like
		switching lamps, shutters, heating and to log events like
		temperature, humidity, power consumption.
		In order to use FHEM you'll need some attached hardware
		like the CUL-, EnOcean- or Z-Wave-USB-Stick to access the actors and sensors.
