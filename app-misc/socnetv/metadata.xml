		Social Networks Visualizer (SocNetV) is a flexible and user-friendly tool for 
		the analysis and visualization of Social Networks. It lets you construct networks 
		(mathematical graphs) with a few clicks on a virtual canvas or load networks of 
		various formats (GraphViz, GraphML, Adjacency, Pajek, UCINET, etc) and modify them 
		to suit your needs. SocNetV also offers a built-in web crawler, allowing you to 
		automatically create networks from all links found in a given initial URL.
