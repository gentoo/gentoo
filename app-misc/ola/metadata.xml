		The Open Lighting Architecture is a framework for lighting control information.
		It supports a range of protocols and over a dozen USB devices. It can run as a
		standalone service, which is useful for converting signals between protocols,
		or alternatively using the OLA API, it can be used as the backend for lighting
		control software. OLA runs on many different platforms including ARM, which
		makes it a perfect fit for low cost Ethernet to DMX gateways.
