		The Logitech Cordless Desktop MX 5000 Laser comes with a keyboard that has a nice LCD.
		But Logitech did not provide any way to control the LCD on a Free operating system.
		These tools make it possible to control what is displayed on the LCD and to use some
		of the keys that are not recognized by the stock Linux HID driver.
