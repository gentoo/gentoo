		Wyrd is a text-based front-end to Remind, a sophisticated calendar and alarm
		program. Remind's power lies in its programmability, and Wyrd does not hide this
		capability behind flashy GUI dialogs. Rather, Wyrd is designed to make you more
		efficient at editing your reminder files directly. It also offers a scrollable
		timetable suitable for visualizing your schedule at a glance.
