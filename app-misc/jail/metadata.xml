Jail Chroot Project is an attempt of write a tool that builds a chrooted environment. 
The main goal of Jail is to be as simple as possible, and highly portable. The most 
difficult step when building a chrooted environment is to set up the right libraries and 
files. Here, Jail comes to the rescue with a tool to automagically configures and builds 
all the required files, directories and libraries.</longdescription>
