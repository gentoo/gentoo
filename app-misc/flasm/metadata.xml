  <longdescription>Flasm disassembles your entire SWF including all the
      timelines and events.  Looking at disassembly, you learn how the Flash
      compiler works, which improves your ActionScript skills. You can also do
      some optimizations on the disassembled code by hand or adjust the code as
      you wish. Flasm then applies your changes to the original SWF, replacing
      original actions.
