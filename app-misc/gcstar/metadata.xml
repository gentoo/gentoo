		GCstar is an application for managing your collections. It supports many
		types of collections, including movies, books, games, comics, stamps,
		coins, and many more. You can even create your own collection type for
		whatever unique thing it is that you collect! Detailed information on
		each item can be automatically retrieved from the internet and you can
		store additional data, such as the location or who you've lent it to.
		You may also search and filter your collections by many criteria.
