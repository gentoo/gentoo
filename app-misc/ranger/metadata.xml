	Ranger is a console file manager that gives you greater flexibility and a
	good overview of your files without having to leave your console. It
	visualizes the directory tree in two dimensions: the directory hierarchy on
	one, lists of files on the other, with a preview to the right so you know
	where you'll be going.
