Subject: [PATCH] update-ca-certificates: drop pointless dependency on external
 run-parts

This external program belongs to debianutils and hence is used
internally by the update-ca-certificates script synced from Debian.

It has a couple utilities:
- it sorts files in a directory with LC_ALL=C
- it runs each of them in turn
- it can print them instead of running them

Here, it's used for sorting and printing the scripts to run. They need
to each accept some stdin, so run-parts cannot actually be used for
dispatch. But this functionality works fine directly from a shell, so
the additional dependency honestly seems frivolous. In particular, this
is the only reason why all Debian systems have debianutils installed,
through openssl. (This is in contrast to Debian, where debianutils is
part of the essential system set and provides a vastly greater number of
programs than the ones Gentoo repackages.)

It's very easy to replace with `printf %s\\n *`, so do so. Even if it
wasn't easy to replace with printf, it would be easy to replace with
`for x in *; "$x"; done` instead.
