		mtail is a small tail workalike that performs output coloring using
		ansi escape sequences (although the sequences are overridable, so you
		could cause it to output something else, e.g. html font tags, if you
		really wanted to). mtail is written in python, is fairly small, and
		should be relatively platform-independent.
