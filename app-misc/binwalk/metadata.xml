  <longdescription lang="en">Binwalk is a tool for searching a given binary image for embedded files.
	Specifically, it is designed for identifying files embedded inside of firmware
	images. Binwalk uses the libmagic library, so it is compatible with magic
	signatures created for the Unix file utility.
	Binwalk also includes a custom magic signature file which contains improved
	signatures for files that are commonly found in firmware images such as
	compressed/archived files, firmware headers, Linux kernels, bootloaders,
	filesystems, etc.</longdescription>
