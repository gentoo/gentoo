			Install symlinks for 'gcc' and 'g++' for extra
			compatibility.
		</flag>
		<flag name="multilib-symlinks">
			Install symlinks for all ABI CHOSTs. Note that this can
			result in gcc being overrode for native builds, as well
			as conflict with crossdev if used for the same targets.
		</flag>
		<flag name="native-symlinks">
			Install generic tool symlinks like 'cc' and 'c++',
			as well as ${CTARGET}-*. These symlinks are installed
			into slotted LLVM bindir, so they should not take precedence
			over symlinks installed into /usr/bin
			by <pkg>sys-devel/gcc-config</pkg> but they can be helpful
			for GCC-free setups.
