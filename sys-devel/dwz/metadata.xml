		The dwz package contains a program that attempts to optimize DWARF
		debugging information contained in ELF shared libraries and ELF executables
		for size, by replacing DWARF information representation with equivalent
		smaller representation where possible and by reducing the amount of
		duplication using techniques from DWARF standard appendix E - creating
		DW_TAG_partial_unit compilation units (CUs) for duplicated information
		and using DW_TAG_imported_unit to import it into each CU that needs it.
