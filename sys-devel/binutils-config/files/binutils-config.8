.SH "NAME"
binutils-config \- manage active versions of the binutils programs
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBbinutils-config\fR script allows you to switch between different 
versions of binutils when you have installed multiple copies (see
USE=multislot).  It also allows you to manage multiple cross-compiling
targets simultaneously.

Remember, you may have one version of binutils active per \fICTARGET\fR,
and changing the version for one target has no bearing on any other.  So
changing an active cross-compiler will not break your native compiler
(i.e. \fICHOST\fR).

.SH "GENERIC OPTIONS"
.TP
\fBPROFILE\fR
Change the system to use the specified binutils version.  This may take the
form of the list index number (the number shown on the left in the
\fB\-\-list\-profiles\fR output), a full \fITARGET-VERSION\fR (useful when
working with cross-compilers), just a \fITARGET\fR where the \fIVERSION\fR
is picked from the active, or just a binutils \fIVERSION\fR where the
\fITARGET\fR is assumed to be the native \fIHOST\fR value.
.TP
\fBTARGET\fR
Similiar to \fBPROFILE\fR, but this is only the target and no version info
(i.e. \fICTARGET\fR or \fICHOST\fR).
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-get\-current\-profile\fR \fI[TARGET]\fR
Display the active profile for \fITARGET\fR.  If none is specified, the 
host system's \fITARGET\fR will be shown (i.e. \fICHOST\fR).
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\-profiles\fR
Show all the profiles that your system currently has installed and what
versions are active.  The active native version is noted with a bright green
asterisk while the active cross-compiler versions are noted with a light blue
asterisk.
.TP
\fB-u\fR, \fB\-\-uninstall\fR \fITARGET\fR
This is really for internal use only.  Used to remove all traces of the 
\fITARGET\fR binutils from your system.
