E is a theorem prover for full first-order logic with equality. It
accepts a problem specification, typically consisting of a number of
first-order clauses or formulas, and a conjecture, again either in
clausal or full first-order form. The system will then try to find a
formal proof for the conjecture, assuming the axioms.

If a proof is found, the system can provide a detailed list of proof
steps that can be individually verified. If the conjecture is
existential (i.e. it’s of the form “there exists an X with property
P”), the latest versions can also provide possible answers (values for
X).

Development of E started as part of the E-SETHEO project at TUM. The
first public release was in in 1998, and the system has been
continuously improved ever since. I believe that E now is one of the
most powerful and friendly reasoning systems for first-order
logic. The prover has successfully participated in many competitions.
