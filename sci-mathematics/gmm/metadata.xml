  Gmm++ is a generic C++ template library for sparse, dense and
  skyline matrices. It is built as a set of generic algorithms (mult,
  add, copy, sub-matrices, dense and sparse solvers ...) for any
  interfaced vector type or matrix type. It can be view as a glue
  library allowing cooperation between several vector and matrix
  types. However, basic sparse, dense and skyline matrix/vector types
  are built in Gmm++, hence it can be used as a standalone linear
  algebra library.
