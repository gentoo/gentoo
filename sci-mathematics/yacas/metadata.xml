  Yacas (Yet Another Computer Algebra System) is a small and highly
  flexible general-purpose computer algebra language. The syntax uses a
  infix-operator grammar parser. The distribution contains a small
  library of mathematical functions, but its real strength is in the
  language in which you can easily write your own symbolic manipulation
  algorithms.
