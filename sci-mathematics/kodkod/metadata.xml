Kodkod is an efficient SAT-based constraint solver for first order
logic with relations, transitive closure, bit-vector arithmetic, and
partial models. It provides analyses for both satisfiable and
unsatisfiable problems: a finite model finder for the former and a
minimal unsatisfiable core extractor for the latter. Kodkod is used in
a wide range of applications, including code checking, test-case
generation, declarative execution, declarative configuration, and
lightweight analysis of Alloy, UML, and Isabelle/HOL.
