  Besides offering an attractive front-end to GNU Octave, an
  environment for numerical computation highly compatible with MATLAB,
  QtOctave currently also features matrix data entry and display and
  some GUI shortcuts to frequently used Octave functions. It also
  offers access in place to Octave's documentation with octave-htmldoc
  or octave-info.
