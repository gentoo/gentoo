  Gfan is a software package for computing Gröbner fans and tropical
  varieties. These are polyhedral fans associated to polynomial
  ideals. The maximal cones of a Gröbner fan are in bijection with the
  marked reduced Gröbner bases of its defining ideal. The software
  computes all marked reduced Gröbner bases of an ideal. Their union
  is a universal Gröbner basis. The tropical variety of a polynomial
  ideal is a certain subcomplex of the Gröbner fan. Gfan contains
  algorithms for computing this complex for general ideals and
  specialized algorithms for tropical curves, tropical hypersurfaces
  and tropical varieties of prime ideals. In addition to the above
  core functions the package contains many tools which are useful in
  the study of Gröbner bases, initial ideals and tropical
  geometry. The full list of commands can be found in Appendix B of
  the manual. For ordinary Gröbner basis computations Gfan is not
  competitive in speed compared to programs such as CoCoA, Singular
  and Macaulay2.
