CVC3 is an automatic theorem prover for Satisfiability Modulo Theories
(SMT) problems. It can be used to prove the validity (or, dually, the
satisfiability) of first-order formulas in a large number of built-in
logical theories and their combination.

CVC3 is the last offspring of a series of popular SMT provers, which
originated at Stanford University with the SVC system. In particular,
it builds on the code base of CVC Lite, its most recent
predecessor. Its high level design follows that of the Sammy prover.

CVC3 works with a version of first-order logic with polymorphic types
and has a wide variety of features including:

    several built-in base theories: rational and integer linear
        arithmetic, arrays, tuples, records, inductive data types, bit
        vectors, and equality over uninterpreted function symbols;
    support for quantifiers;
    an interactive text-based interface;
    a rich C and C++ API for embedding in other systems;
    proof and model generation abilities;
    predicate subtyping;
    essentially no limit on its use for research or commercial
        purposes (see license).
