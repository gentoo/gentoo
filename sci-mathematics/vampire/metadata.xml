    Vampire is a theorem prover, that is, a system able to prove theorems â€”
    although now it can do much more! Its main focus is in proving theorems in
    first-order logic but it can also prove non-theorems and build finite
    models, as well as reasoning in combinations of theories, such as
    arithmetic, arrays, and datatypes, and with higher-order logic.
    The development of Vampire began in 1994 and has survived a number of
    rewritings.
