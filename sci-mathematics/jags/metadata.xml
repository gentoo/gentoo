  JAGS is Just Another Gibbs Sampler. It is a program for analysis of
  Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
  simulation not wholly unlike BUGS.
  JAGS was written with three aims in mind:
  * To have an engine for the BUGS language that runs on Unix
  * To be extensible, allowing users to write their own functions,
    distributions and samplers.
  * To be a plaftorm for experimentation with ideas in Bayesian modelling
