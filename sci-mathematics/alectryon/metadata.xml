  <longdescription>
    A library to process Coq and Lean snippets embedded in text documents,
    showing goals and messages for each input sentence. Also a literate
    programming toolkit. The goal of Alectryon is to make it easy to write
    textbooks, blog posts, and other documents that mix interactive proofs and
    prose.
    Alectryon originally supported Coq only. Support for Lean is preliminary
    and restricted to Lean 3.
