    Kind 2 is an open-source, multi-engine, SMT-based automatic model checker
    for safety properties of finite-state or infinite-state synchronous
    reactive systems expressed as in an extension of the Lustre language. In
    its basic configuration it takes as input one or more Lustre files
    annotated with properties to be proven invariant, and outputs for each
    property either a confirmation or a counterexample, i.e., a sequence inputs
    that falsifies the property. More advanced features include contract-based
    compositional verification, proof generation for proven properties, and
    contract-based test generation.
