    Z3 is an efficient Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver from
    Microsoft Research. Z3 is a solver for symbolic logic, a foundation for
    many software engineering tools. SMT solvers rely on a tight integration of
    specialized engines of proof. Each engine owns a piece of the global puzzle
    and implements specialized algorithms. For example, Z3â€™s engine for
    arithmetic integrates Simplex, cuts and polynomial reasoning, while an
    engine for strings are regular expressions integrate methods for symbolic
    derivatives of regular languages. A theme shared among many of the
    algorithms is how they exploit a duality between finding satisfying
    solutions and finding refutation proofs. The solver also integrates engines
    for global and local inferences and global propagation. Z3 is used in a
    wide range of software engineering applications, ranging from program
    verification, compiler validation, testing, fuzzing using dynamic symbolic
    execution, model-based software development, network verification, and
    optimization.
