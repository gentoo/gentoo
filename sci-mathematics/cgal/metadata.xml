  The Computational Geometry Algorithms Library is a collaborative
  open source library containing:
  * the Kernel with geometric primitives such as points, vectors,
    lines, predicates for testing things such as relative positions of
    points, and operations such as intersections and distance calculation.
  * the Basic Library which is a collection of standard data
    structures and geometric algorithms, such as convex hull in 2D/3D,
    (Delaunay) triangulation in 2D/3D, planar map, polyhedron, smallest
    enclosing circle, and multidimensional query structures.
  * the Support Library which offers interfaces to other packages,
    e.g., for visualisation, and I/O, and other support facilities.
