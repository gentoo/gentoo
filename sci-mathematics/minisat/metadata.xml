		MiniSat is a minimalistic, open-source SAT solver, developed to help
		researchers and developers alike to get started on SAT. It is released
		under the MIT licence, and is currently used in a number of projects.
		MiniSat is small and well-documented, and possibly also well-designed,
		making it an ideal starting point for adapting SAT based techniques to
		domain specific problems.
		Winning all the industrial categories of the SAT 2005 competition, MiniSat
		is a good starting point both for future research in SAT, and for
		applications using SAT.
		MiniSat supports incremental SAT and has mechanisms for adding non-clausal
		constraints. By virtue of being easy to modify, it is a good choice for
		integrating as a backend to another tool, such as a model checker or a more
		generic constraint solver.
