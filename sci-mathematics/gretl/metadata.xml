  GNU Regression, Econometrics and Time-series Library provides
  a library which comprises various functions relating to econometric
  estimation, a command-line client program and a GUI. The library is
  based on the stand-alone command-line econometrics program ESL,
  originally written by Ramu Ramanathan of the Department of Economics
  at UC-San Diego. The interfaces offer several least-squares based
  estimators. Besides reading data files in its own format it also
  reads RATS 4 databases. It has a built-in spreadsheet for editing
  data, and uses gnuplot for graphing. It can output regression results
  in LaTeX format.
