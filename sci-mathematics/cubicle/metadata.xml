    Cubicle is an open source model checker for verifying safety properties of
    array-based systems. This is a syntactically restricted class of
    parametrized transition systems with states represented as arrays indexed
    by an arbitrary number of processes. Cache coherence protocols and mutual
    exclusion algorithms are typical examples of such systems. Cubicle
    model-checks by a symbolic backward reachability analysis on infinite sets
    of states represented by specific simple formulas, called cubes. Cubicle is
    based on ideas introduced by MCMT from which, in addition to revealing the
    implementation details, it differs in a more friendly input language and a
    concurrent architecture. Cubicle is written in OCaml. Its SMT solver is a
    tightly integrated, lightweight and enhanced version of Alt-Ergo; and its
    parallel implementation relies on the Functory library.
