    Yices 2 is an SMT solver that decides the satisfiability of formulas
    containing uninterpreted function symbols with equality, real and integer
    arithmetic, bitvectors, scalar types, and tuples. Yices 2 supports both
    linear and nonlinear arithmetic. Yices 2 can process input written in the
    SMT-LIB notation (both versions 2.0 and 1.2 are supported). Alternatively,
    you can write specifications using Yices 2's own specification language,
    which includes tuples and scalar types. You can also use Yices 2 as a
    library in your software.
