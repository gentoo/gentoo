  PARI is a widely used computer algebra system designed for fast
  computations in number theory (factorizations, algebraic number
  theory, elliptic curves...), but also contains a large number of other
  useful functions to compute with mathematical entities such as
  matrices, polynomials, power series, algebraic numbers, etc., and a
  lot of transcendental functions.
  The extra data is avaialable through use flag:
  * elldata is PARI/GP version of J. E. Cremona Elliptic Curve Data,
    needed by ellsearch and ellidentify.
  * galdata is needed by polgalois to compute Galois group in degrees
    8 through 11.
  * seadata is needed by ellap for large primes.
  * nftables is a repackaging of the historical megrez number field
tables (errors fixed, 1/10th the size, easier to use).
