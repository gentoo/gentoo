	Developed in the LogiCal project, the Coq tool is a formal proof
	management system: a proof done with Coq is mechanically checked
	by the machine.

	In particular, Coq allows:
	* the definition of functions or predicates,
	* to state mathematical theorems and software specifications,
	* to develop interactively formal proofs of these theorems,
	* to check these proofs by a small certification "kernel".

	Coq is based on a logical framework called "Calculus of Inductive
	Constructions" extended by a modular development system for
	theories.
