  Developed in the LogiCal project, the Coq tool is a formal proof
  management system: a proof done with Coq is mechanically checked
  by the machine.
  In particular, Coq allows:
  * the definition of functions or predicates,
  * to state mathematical theorems and software specifications,
  * to develop interactively formal proofs of these theorems,
  * to check these proofs by a small certification "kernel".
  Coq is based on a logical framework called "Calculus of Inductive
  Constructions" extended by a modular development system for
  theories.
