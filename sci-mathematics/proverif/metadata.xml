    ProVerif is an automatic cryptographic protocol verifier, in the formal
    model (so called Dolev-Yao model). This protocol verifier is based on a
    representation of the protocol by Horn clauses. Its main features are: 1)
    It can handle many different cryptographic primitives, including shared-
    and public-key cryptography (encryption and signatures), hash functions,
    and Diffie-Hellman key agreements, specified both as rewrite rules or as
    equations. 2) It can handle an unbounded number of sessions of the protocol
    (even in parallel) and an unbounded message space. This result has been
    obtained thanks to some well-chosen approximations. This means that the
    verifier can give false attacks, but if it claims that the protocol
    satisfies some property, then the property is actually satisfied. The
    considered resolution algorithm terminates on a large class of protocols
    (the so-called "tagged" protocols). When the tool cannot prove a property,
    it tries to reconstruct an attack, that is, an execution trace of the
    protocol that falsifies the desired property.
