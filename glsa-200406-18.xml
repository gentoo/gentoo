  <background>
    <p>
    gzip (GNU zip) is popular compression program. The included gzexe
    utility allows you to compress executables in place and have them
    automatically uncompress and execute when you run them.
    </p>
  </background>
  <description>
    <p>
    The script gzexe included with gzip contains a bug in the code that
    handles tempfile creation. If the creation of a temp file fails when
    using gzexe fails instead of bailing out it executes the command given
    as argument.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    This could lead to priviege escalation by running commands under the
    rights of the user running the self extracting file.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time. All users are encouraged to
    upgrade to the latest available version.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All gzip users should upgrade to the latest stable version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge sync
    
    # emerge -pv "&gt;=app-arch/gzip-1.3.3-r4"
    # emerge "&gt;=app-arch/gzip-1.3.3-r4"</code>
    <p>
    Additionally, once the upgrade is complete, all self extracting files
    created with earlier versions gzexe should be recreated, since the
    vulnerability is actually embedded in those executables.
    </p>
