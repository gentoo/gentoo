    Scalpel is a fast file carver that reads a database of header and footer
    definitions and extracts matching files or data fragments from a set of image
    files or raw device files. Scalpel is filesystem-independent and will carve
    files from FATx, NTFS, ext2/3, HFS+, or raw partitions. It is useful for both
    digital forensics investigation and file recovery.
