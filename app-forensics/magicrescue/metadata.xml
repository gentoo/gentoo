	Magic Rescue scans a block device for file types it knows how to recover and calls an external program to extract them. It looks
	at "magic bytes" in file contents, so it can be used both as an undelete utility and for recovering a corrupted drive or
	partition. As long as the file data is there, it will find it.

	It works on any file system, but on very fragmented file systems it can only recover the first chunk of each file. Practical
	experience (this program was not written for fun) shows, however, that chunks of 30-50MB are not uncommon.
