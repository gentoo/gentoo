		Packages supporting a combination of Chinese, Japanese, Korean,
		including macros, fonts, documentation.  Also Thai in the c90
		encoding, since there is some overlap in those fonts; standard
		Thai support is in collection-langother.  Additional packages
		for CJK are in their individual language collections.
