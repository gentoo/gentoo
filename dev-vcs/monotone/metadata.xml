	<longdescription>A free distributed version control system. It provides a simple,
single-file transactional version store, with fully disconnected
operation and an efficient peer-to-peer synchronization
protocol. It understands history-sensitive merging, lightweight
branches, integrated code review and 3rd party testing. It uses
cryptographic version naming and client-side RSA certificates. It
has good internationalization support, has no external
dependencies, runs on linux, solaris, OSX, windows, and other
unixes, and is licensed under the GNU GPL.
