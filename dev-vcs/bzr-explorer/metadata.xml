    Bazaar Explorer is a desktop application for using the Bazaar
    Version Control System. It provides a high level interface to all
    commonly used features, launching "applets" from the QBzr plug-in
    to provide most of the functionality. Alternatively, the applets
    from the bzr-gtk plug-in can be used if it is installed.
