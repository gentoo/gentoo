    Bazaar (``bzr``) is a decentralized revision control system, designed to be
    easy for developers and end users alike.  Bazaar is part of the GNU project
    to develop a complete free operating system.
    Bazaar was formerly known as Bazaar-NG.  It's the successor to ``baz``, a
    fork of GNU arch, but shares no code.  (To upgrade from Baz, use the
    ``baz-import`` command in the bzrtools plugin.)
