		git-annex allows managing files with git, without checking the file
		contents into git. While that may seem paradoxical, it is useful when
		dealing with files larger than git can currently easily handle, whether due
		to limitations in memory, time, or disk space.
		
		It can store large files in many places, from local hard drives, to a
		large number of cloud storage services, including S3, WebDAV,
		and rsync, with a dozen cloud storage providers usable via plugins.
		Files can be stored encrypted with gpg, so that the cloud storage
		provider cannot see your data. git-annex keeps track of where each file
		is stored, so it knows how many copies are available, and has many
		facilities to ensure your data is preserved.
		
		git-annex can also be used to keep a folder in sync between computers,
		noticing when files are changed, and automatically committing them
		to git and transferring them to other computers. The git-annex webapp
		makes it easy to set up and use git-annex this way.
