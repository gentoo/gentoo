Jools is a graphical puzzle game in the tradition of Tetris. It has begun as
a clone of Bejeweled, which is currently available for Windows, Mac, and
Palm/Pocket PC devices.  In a nutshell, the goal is to swap adjacent jools
(jewels) within a grid, in order to create rows of three or more of a kind.
These jools will then disappear, and more will fall to fill their places.
