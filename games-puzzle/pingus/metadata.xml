	<longdescription>Pingus is a free Lemmings clone for GNU/Linux and Windows covered under the GNU GPL. Pingus
uses ClanLib and libxml and might also be usable on some other OSs like FreeBSD, but hasn't
been tested there. Pingus is mainly developed under GNU/Linux, that's why the Windows port
is sometimes a bit behind.
If you don't know Lemmingstm, here comes a short introduction. Its a puzzle game developed
in 1991 by DMA Design. The player takes command in the game of a bunch of small animals and
has to guide them around in levels. Since the animals walk on their own, the player can only
influence them by giving them commands, like build a bridge, dig a hole or redirect all
animals in the other direction. The goal of each level is to reach the exit, for fix
multiple combination of commands are necessary. The game is presented in a 2D site view.</longdescription>
