1) We'd suggest you to install following packages
   sys-block/parted		to manage disk partions
   sys-fs/btrfs-progs	to use btrfs filesytem
   sys-fs/cryptsetup		to use encrypted devices with dm-crypt

2) To start several daemons of one specific type, create your own scripts
   cd /etc/init.d
   for dmn in mds.a mon.a osd.0 osd.1 osd.2; do
     ln -s ceph ceph-${dmn};
     rc-update add ceph-${dmn} default;
   done

3) If you spread ceph daemons over several different machines,
 We'd highly recommend you to start ntp-client to keep the system time sync.
 Try to choose one of following ntp client to install and add into runlevel.
   net-misc/ntp
   net-misc/openntpd
   net-misc/chrony

4) Starting from version 9.0.x, Ceph daemons run as ‘ceph’ user instead root.
   In order to fix this, we suggest to stop ceph daemons, and fix ownership

    chown -R ceph:ceph /var/lib/ceph
