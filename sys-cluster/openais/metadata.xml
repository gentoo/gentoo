		The OpenAIS Standards Based Cluster Framework is an OSI Certified implementation of 
		the Service Availability Forum Application Interface Specification (AIS). 
		The Application Interface Specification is a software API and policies which are 
		used to develop applications that maintain service during faults. 
		Restarting and failover of applications is also provided for those 
		deploying applications which may not be modified. The OpenAIS software is built 
		to operate as plugins to the Corosync Cluster Engine.
