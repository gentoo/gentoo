  Classified Advertisements (classads) are the lingua franca of
  Condor. They are used for describing jobs, workstations, and other
  resources. They are exchanged by Condor processes to schedule
  jobs. They are logged to files for statistical and debugging
  purposes. They are used to enquire about current state of the system.
