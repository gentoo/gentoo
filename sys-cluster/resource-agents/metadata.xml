		Resource agents are a standardized interfaces for a cluster resource. 
		They translate a standard set of operations into steps specific to 
		the resource or application, and interpret their results as success or
		failure. Previously, they were a part of the then-monolithic Heartbeat 
		project, and had no collective name.
