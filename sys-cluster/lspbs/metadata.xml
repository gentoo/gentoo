    Lspbs is a lightweight alternative to the xpbsmon utility, which
    is part of the OpenPBS package.  It uses the color xterm to
    display clear, concise and up-to-date node and CPU usage
    information.  Lspbs also supports unformatted printing and can
    filter nodes by their properties and current state.  This generic
    filtering feature extends the simplistic functionality provided by
    the pbsnodes utility, which is also part of the OpenPBS
    package. This makes lspbs useful for managing PBS-based clusters.
