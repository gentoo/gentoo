Subject: [PATCH] Fix build with Linux kernel headers v4.15

Linux kernel version 4.15 changed the libc/kernel headers suppression
logic in a way that introduces collisions:

In file included from ./../include/vrrp_ipaddress.h:32:0,
                 from ./../include/vrrp_arp.h:31,
                 from vrrp.c:29:
/home/peko/autobuild/instance-1/output/host/arc-buildroot-linux-uclibc/sysroot/usr/include/linux/in.h:29:3: error: redeclaration of enumerator 'IPPROTO_IP'
   IPPROTO_IP = 0,  /* Dummy protocol for TCP  */
   ^
/home/peko/autobuild/instance-1/output/host/arc-buildroot-linux-uclibc/sysroot/usr/include/netinet/in.h:33:5: note: previous definition of 'IPPROTO_IP' was here
     IPPROTO_IP = 0,    /* Dummy protocol for TCP.  */
     ^~~~~~~~~~

Include the libc netinet/in.h header first to suppress the kernel
header.

In addition, add _GNU_SOURCE to vrrp.c for the libc provided in6_pktinfo
definition.
