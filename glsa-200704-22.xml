    BEdevilled Audio SysTem is an audio compositor, supporting a wide range
    of audio formats.

  <description>
    <p>
    BEAST, which is installed as setuid root, fails to properly check
    whether it can drop privileges accordingly if seteuid() fails due to a
    user exceeding assigned resource limits.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="low">
    <p>
    A local user could exceed his resource limit in order to prevent the
    seteuid() call from succeeding. This may lead BEAST to keep running
    with root privileges. Then, the local user could use the "save as"
    dialog box to overwrite any file on the vulnerable system, potentially
    leading to a Denial of Service.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
    </p>
  </workaround>
  <resolution>
    <p>
    All BEAST users should upgrade to the latest version:
    </p>
    <code>
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "&gt;=media-sound/beast-0.7.1"</code>
  </resolution>
